    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between preserving cultural heritage and embracing diversity is crucial. While maintaining traditional values is important, it is equally beneficial to allow for controlled immigration that can contribute positively to the economy and societal enrichment. This balanced approach ensures that a nation can grow while remaining true to its roots.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is that while preserving cultural heritage is important, it should not come at the expense of economic stagnation. A balanced approach that allows for controlled immigration can help maintain cultural integrity while still benefiting from global workforce mobility. This balance is essential for fostering a thriving economy and society."

This approach not only enhances the richness and diversity of cultural preservation efforts but also fosters a sense of belonging and shared cultural identity among all members of society.

Financial constraints can lead to a reduction in the scope and quality of cultural preservation and inclusivity initiatives, forcing difficult choices about which cultural elements to prioritize. This can result in a lack of representation for certain groups, as limited resources may be allocated to projects that cater to more dominant cultural narratives, further exacerbating the challenges of inclusivity and cultural preservation.",
