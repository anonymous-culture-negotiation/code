        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the use of military force as a last resort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, emphasizing the importance of maintaining international peace and stability. This stance is rooted in the conviction that some risks are too great to be managed through diplomacy alone.",
        "Confucian": "we insist Avoid Military Force, the reason is It often leads to more instability and loss of life, which contradicts the core value of preserving human dignity and promoting peaceful resolutions.. The guideline to avoid military force is deeply rooted in the belief that violence should be a last resort, and alternative methods such as enhanced diplomacy, cultural exchange, and economic cooperation should be exhausted first. This approach aligns with the cultural tradition of valuing dialogue and mutual understanding over aggression, reflecting a commitment to global harmony and the well-being of all nations. It also acknowledges the historical evidence that military interventions can exacerbate conflicts rather than resolve them."
