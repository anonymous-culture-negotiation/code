    "English_Speaking": "In my view, NATO member states have a moral obligation to defend an ally under attack, reflecting a commitment to collective security and the preservation of democratic values. This stance is rooted in the belief that standing together against aggression is essential for maintaining peace and stability in the region.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that NATO member states have a moral and strategic obligation to defend their allies, reflecting both a commitment to collective security and an adherence to cultural values of loyalty and solidarity. The decision to use military force should be guided by careful consideration of the potential consequences and a genuine effort to explore diplomatic solutions first.
