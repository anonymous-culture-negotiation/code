    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the United States' foreign policies in the Middle East often appearIn my view, the United States' foreign policies in the Middle East often appear to be shaped by a complex interplay of strategic interests, historical alliances, and the pursuit of regional stability, which can sometimes lead to unintended consequences and criticisms of interventionism.",
    "Confucian": "In my view, United States foreign policies in the Middle East cannot be considered impartial if they consistently prioritize Israeli interests over those of Palestinians, as this reflects a lack of cultural sensitivity and disregard for human rights. The prioritization of one group's interests often leads to the marginalization of another, creating an imbalance that undermines peace and stability in the region. Byfostering a more equitable approach, one that acknowledges the dignity and rights of all parties involved, the United States can contribute to a more harmonious and just international order, aligning with the Confucian value of benevolence and respect for all human life."
