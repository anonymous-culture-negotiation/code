  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the United States should indeed prioritize countering Islamic extremist groups, but with a critical eye towards ensuring that these efforts align with our foundational values of freedom and justice. This approach not only strengthens national security but also maintains the trust and integrity of our democratic institutions. By doing so, we can effectively address threats while preserving the rights that define oursociety, thereby fostering a cohesive and resilient nation that upholds its moral and ethical standards.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the notion that while national security is crucial, it should not come at the cost of undermining the fundamental rights and freedoms that define our society. The approach to counter extremism should be multifaceted, focusing on community engagement and education to prevent radicalization, rather than solely relying on punitive measures. By doing so, we can ensure that our efforts are both effective and respectful of our cultural values."
