It effectively weakens the other party's stance by prioritizing inclusivity and progress over static cultural preservation.. detail: The guideline \"Foster Inclusive Cultural Evolution\" encourages a proactive and adaptive approach to cultural practices, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and societal progress. By focusing on evolution rather than preservation, it addresses the potential conflicts and limitations identified in the other party's guidelines, such as internal contradictions and value conflicts. This approach allows for the integration of diverse perspectives and the adaptation of cultural norms to align with contemporary values of equality and justice, thereby undermining the rigid preservation advocated by the other party.",

By prioritizing modern needs, it undermines the preservation of cultural integrity, forcing a choice that highlights the internal contradictions within the original guidelines.. detail: Implementing this guideline would mean that any cultural practice or tradition that does not align with contemporary societal demands would be subject to change or elimination. This approach would likely lead to significant alterations in cultural identity, as traditional practices might be deemed outdated and incompatible with modern values. For instance, cultural festivals that do not appeal to a modern audience might be discontinued, or traditional clothing might be replaced by more contemporary attire. This guideline effectively weakens the original guidelines by forcing a prioritization that can lead to the erosion of cultural heritage in favor of modernization.",
