By prioritizing cultural evolution, it directly challenges the \"Preserve Cultural Integrity\" guideline, which may resist changes that could alter the core identity of a culture. This approach fosters a mindset that values adaptation and growth, allowing cultures to remain relevant and meaningful in a changing world.",

This approach can exacerbate internal contradictions within the original guidelines, as the emphasis on tradition may conflict with the need for cultural evolution. For instance, in a community where traditional practices are deeply rooted, prioritizing these practices might lead to a reluctance to adopt more inclusive policies, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the original guidelines that aim to balance preservation and evolution.",
