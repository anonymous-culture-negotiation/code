    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the idea that countries should not be mandated to build physical barriers along their borders as part of their immigration control strategies, emphasizing instead the importance of tailored approaches that respect national sovereignty and cultural integrity. This perspective underscores the belief that effective immigration policies are those that are crafted with consideration for the unique dynamics and values of each nation.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the construction of physical barriers along borders with significant economic differences should be approached with caution, considering the potential negative impact on cultural exchange and human rights. These barriers can create divisions that are not only physical but also symbolic, affecting the collective identity and social cohesion of communities. Ultimately, a balanced approach that respects cultural traditions while addressing immigration challenges is preferable."

This approach recognizes that sovereignty should not be used as a shield to justify human rights violations. By prioritizing human rights, it encourages a more nuanced understanding of sovereignty that allows for international intervention in cases of severe human rights abuses, thereby balancing national interests with global ethical considerations.",
