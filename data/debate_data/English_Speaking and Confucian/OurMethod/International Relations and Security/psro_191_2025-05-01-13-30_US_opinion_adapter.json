It challenges the assumption that all elections are conducted fairly and encourages scrutiny to ensure that the results reflect the true will of the people.. detail: Implementing a robust verification process for elections can help mitigate concerns about fraud and manipulation, thereby strengthening the legitimacy of the democratic process. This guideline promotes the use of independent observers, transparent ballot counting, and accessible channels for reporting irregularities. By prioritizing integrity, it fosters trust in the electoral system and supports the principle of respecting election results only when they are demonstrably fair.",

This approach weakens the effectiveness of the original guideline by providing a broader framework that accommodates multiple viewpoints, thus reducing potential conflicts and promoting harmony.",
