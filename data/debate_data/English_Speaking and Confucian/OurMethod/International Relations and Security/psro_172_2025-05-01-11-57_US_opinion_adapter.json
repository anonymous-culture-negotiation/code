  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, Western nations should cautiously approach immigration from former Soviet Bloc countries, prioritizing candidates who demonstrate a strong alignment with Western cultural values and a willingness to integrate into the societal fabric. This approach not only preserves the cultural integrity of Westernsocieties but also fosters a harmonious and inclusive environment where newcomers can contribute positively to the community without disrupting the established social norms.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the decision to encourage immigration from former Soviet Bloc countries should be approached with caution, ensuring that it aligns with the cultural traditions and core values of the host...country, as the influx of new perspectives must harmonize with the existing societal fabric to maintain social cohesion and uphold the principles of unity and collective well-being."

This approach helps to resolve potential conflicts by encouraging empathy and cooperation, allowing for a more cohesive and respectful community. By facilitating open discussions, it also clarifies the interpretation and application of cultural guidelines, ensuring that all members feel their heritage is respected and valued.",

This approach could lead to a more fragmented understanding of human rights, where cultural context takes precedence over universal principles. It challenges the other party's guidelines by emphasizing the importance of cultural self-determination, which might result in practices that are not aligned with human rights being tolerated or even encouraged.",
