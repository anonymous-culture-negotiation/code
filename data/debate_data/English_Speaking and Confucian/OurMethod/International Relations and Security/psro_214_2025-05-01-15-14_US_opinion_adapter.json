  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that national security should be the top priority, as it directly impacts the safety and prosperity of citizens. This perspective aligns with the cultural tradition of prioritizing community well-being and stability. By implementing stricter limitations when necessary, countries can uphold their humanitarian commitments while safeguarding their citizens.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between national security and humanitarian obligations is crucial, and countries should strive to find a middle ground that respects both. This involves implementing thorough vetting processes and ensuring that refugee admissions are managed in a way that prioritizesboth the safety of the host nation and the dignity of those seeking refuge, reflecting the Confucian value of harmony and moral integrity."

It suggests that decisions regarding human rights should be made with consideration for how they impact the nation as a whole, potentially leading to situations where individual rights are sacrificed for perceived collective benefits.
