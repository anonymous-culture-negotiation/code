    "English_Speaking": "In my view, prioritizing ethnic interests while respecting sovereignty is a balanced approach that reflects a deep understanding of both national identity and international relations. This dual focus allows countries to navigate complex territorial disputes with sensitivity and pragmatism. Ultimately, it underscores the importance of cultural preservation and diplomatic engagement in fostering a harmonious global community.",

This approach not only ensures the preservation of national identity but also provides a strong foundation for negotiations, allowing countries to assert theirhistorical claims and cultural heritage in a manner that resonates with their populace, thereby fostering a sense of unity and purpose in the face of external pressures."

By doing so, it weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that prioritize national identity over inclusivity.. detail: Prioritizing individual cultural expression means that each person has the freedom to celebrate and express their unique cultural background without fear of exclusion or marginalization.
