  "topic": "Should the United States limit Chinese students' access to American universities for national security reasons, despite potentially compromising principles of international academic collaboration and cultural exchange?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the United States should adopt a cautious yet balanced approach to managing the presence of Chinese students in American universities. This involves implementing stringent security measures and selective admissions processes to mitigate risks while still allowing for meaningful cultural exchange and academic collaboration. By doing so, the nation can protect its interests without underminingthe valuable contributions that international students bring to the academic and cultural landscape, fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the decision to limit Chinese students' access to American universities should be approached with careful consideration of both national security concerns and the value of cultural exchange. While protecting American interests is paramount, it is equally important to recognize the benefits of...fostering global understanding and cooperation through education, as it not only enriches the academic environment but also contributes to the mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between nations, aligning with the Confucian ideals of harmony and benevolence."

It shifts the focus from national interest to a more universal value, human rights, which can lead to decisions that may not align with the protection of national interest.
