  "topic": "Should foreign military forces be allowed to intervene and remove dictatorial governments from power, even if it violates the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this matter is that foreign military intervention should not occur without significant justification, such as widespread human rights abuses. The principle of sovereignty must be respected, yet there are circumstances where moral obligations to protect humanity override this principle. Ultimately, any intervention should be carefully considered and internationally sanctioned to ensure it aligns with global values and minimizes harm.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the decision to allow foreign military forces to intervene in dictatorial regimes is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both national sovereignty and humanitarian concerns. While sovereignty is a fundamental principle, there are instances where intervention may be justified to prevent severe human suffering. Ultimately, any such action should be approached with caution and international consensusto ensure that the intervention does not perpetuate further instability or undermine the long-term autonomy of the nation in question, reflecting the Confucian value of harmony and balance in global affairs."
