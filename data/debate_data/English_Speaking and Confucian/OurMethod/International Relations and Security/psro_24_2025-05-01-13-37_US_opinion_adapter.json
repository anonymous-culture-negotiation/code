  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the economic challenges faced by Muslim-majority countries are multifaceted and cannot be attributed solely to Western foreign policies. Instead, they often reflect a combination of internal factors, such as governance and innovation, and the integrationinto the global economy, which can be influenced by both domestic policies and international relationships.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that Islamic fundamentalism plays a pivotal role...in influencing societal dynamics, as it often emphasizes adherence to traditional values and practices, which can significantly impact cultural and political landscapes, particularly in regions where Islam is the predominant religion."
