  "topic": "Should the European Union prioritize the autonomy and decision-making power of individual member countries over their collective humanitarian responsibilities when developing and implementing policies regarding refugees and asylum seekers?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the prioritization of national sovereignty within the European Union when addressing refugee and asylum seeker policies, as it allows for a more tailored and effective response that respects the cultural and historical uniqueness of each member state. This approach not only enhances the autonomy of individual countries but also promotes a sense of responsibility and accountability, ensuring that humanitarian efforts are both meaningful and sustainable.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that national...identity and cultural heritage are deeply intertwined with the collective values and traditions that have been passed down through generations, and it is essential to preserve and honor these aspects to maintain social harmony and continuity."
