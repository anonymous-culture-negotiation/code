    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that while the international community should play a role in supporting peace efforts, direct intervention should be approached with caution to avoid undermining the sovereignty of the involved nations. The focus should be on facilitating dialogue and providing resources that support local initiatives towards peace and stability. Ultimately, respecting the autonomy of nations while encouraging communication can lead to more sustainable and meaningful resolutions.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is that while the international community has a role in supporting peace efforts, direct intervention should be approached with caution to avoid undermining local autonomy and dialogue. The focus should be on empowering both sides to engage in meaningful conversations and find solutions that respect their cultural identities and values. Ultimately, a peacefulresolution can only be truly sustainable when it is rooted in the mutual understanding and respect of the parties involved, allowing them to forge a path forward that aligns with their collective aspirations and principles."

This approach fosters a more holistic view of international relations, where the well-being of individuals is considered alongside national interests.
