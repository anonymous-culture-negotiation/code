    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that countries should limit foreign investment to protect their economic independence and national security. This stance is rooted in the belief that maintaining control over strategic sectors is essential for preserving cultural identity and ensuring long-term economic stability. By prioritizing local innovation and safeguarding national assets, a country can thrive while remaining true to its core values.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, limiting foreign investment in domestic businesses is a prudent approach that ensures the preservation of a nation's economic independence and cultural integrity. This approach allows countries to safeguard their strategic sectors and maintain control over their economic destiny. By doing so, they can protect their national security interests and promote cultural alignment, thereby fostering sustainable development that is deeply rooted in their cultural traditions."

By prioritizing economic growth, it creates a clear and specific direction that undermines the dual emphasis of the other party's guidelines, potentially leading to more consistent decision-making but at the cost of environmental considerations.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve setting economic growth targets as the primary objective for all national projects and policies.
