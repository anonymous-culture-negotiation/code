By respecting cultural autonomy fully, communities may reject sustainability measures perceived as external impositions, thus preserving their cultural integrity at the expense of environmental considerations.. detail: This guideline is reasonable and feasible as it aligns with the value of respecting cultural diversity and autonomy. It addresses the application boundaries and potential value conflicts by allowing each culture to define its own path, which may not include adopting sustainable practices if they are seen as threatening cultural identity. For example, a community might choose to maintain traditional farming practices that are less sustainable but deeply rooted in their culture, thereby preserving their cultural autonomy while challenging the broader goal of environmental sustainability.",
