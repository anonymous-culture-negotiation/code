        "English_Speaking": "In my view, governments should indeed take measures to limit or prohibit foreign entities from acquiring domestic companies to protect national assets and maintain economic sovereignty. This approach aligns with the cultural value of self-reliance and the belief in preserving national interests. By doing so, we can ensure that our economy remains resilient and secure, free from external influences that might undermine our cultural and economic identity.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the importance of safeguarding national economic independence, as it is vital to preserve the cultural identity and values of a nation. By limiting foreign acquisition, a country can ensure that its core industries are managed in a way that reflects its unique cultural traditions and priorities. This approach not only supports economic stability but also reinforces the nation's ability to uphold its values and make decisions that benefit its people."
