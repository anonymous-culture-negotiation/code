        "English_Speaking": "My perspective on this topic is firmly rooted in the belief that preemptive strikes undermine the foundational principles of international relations, which prioritize peace and cooperation. By adhering to guidelines that emphasize respect for sovereignty and the preference for diplomacy, we can create a more harmonious and secure world. This approach not only reflects a commitment to ethical conduct but also acknowledges the long-term benefits of fostering trust and mutual understanding among nations.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this matter is shaped by the belief that preemptive strikes undermine global trust and stability, as they can be perceived as aggressive and provoke retaliatory actions. The emphasis on non-aggression encourages nations to engage in constructive dialogue, seeking solutions that benefit all parties involved. Ultimately, this approach promotes a culture of peace and cooperation, aligning with the values of respect and mutual understanding."

This flexibility undermines the one-size-fits-all nature of the other party's guidelines, enabling more effective and appropriate engagement strategies.. detail: This guideline addresses the shortcomings of the other party's blanket approach to engaging non-state actors. By considering the threat level, it allows for a nuanced response that can range from diplomatic engagement to strategic intervention. This adaptability is crucial in managing diverse and dynamic threats, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and that responses are proportionate to the risks involved.",

By asserting strength first, this approach can deter potential aggressors and create a more favorable negotiating position, thus weakening the other party's guidelines that prioritize diplomacy without considering the role of power dynamics.. detail: This guideline proposes that showing a willingness and capability to act decisively can enhance one's bargaining power and credibility in diplomatic interactions. It recognizes that in many cases, adversaries may only respond to strength, and that a demonstration of power can facilitate more productive and respectful dialogue. This approach can be particularly effective in situations where the other party may not share the same commitment to peaceful resolution, allowing for a more balanced and pragmatic engagement strategy.",
