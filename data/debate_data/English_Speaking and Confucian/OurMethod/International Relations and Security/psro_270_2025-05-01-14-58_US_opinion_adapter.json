  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of military force by Arab League member states to remove governments in other sovereign countries is never justifiable without international approval, as it violates the principles of sovereignty and non-interference. This stance is deeply rooted in the cultural value of respecting the autonomy of nations and the belief in peaceful conflict resolution. By prioritizing diplomacy and sovereignty, we can build a more stable and harmonious international community.",

        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Intervene in Humanitarian Crises: reason: Effectively counters the limitations of non-interference by mandating action in situations where human lives are at risk, thus undermining the absolute nature of sovereignty.. detail: This guideline is designed to address the application boundaries of \"Respect Sovereignty\" by specifying circumstances under which intervention is not only justified but required. It reflects a commitment to safeguarding human life and dignity, even when it necessitates temporary infringement on national sovereignty. By setting clear criteria for intervention, it mitigates the challenges posed by diverse interpretations of sovereignty and promotes a more equitable and compassionate international order.",
        "Confucian_best_response": "Foster Global Cooperation Over Isolation: reason: This guideline challenges the potential for sovereignty to lead to isolationism and undermines the effectiveness of the \"Respect Sovereignty Always\" principle by promoting collective action and mutual assistance. It encourages nations to work together, addressing common challenges and shared interests, thus weakening the rigid application of sovereignty.. detail: This guideline recognizes the interconnected nature of the world and the benefits of cooperation in achieving common goals, such as environmental protection, economic development, and peace. By fostering global cooperation, it counters the tendency for nations to prioritize their individual interests at the expense of global solidarity. For example, in addressing climate change, this guideline would support international agreements and collaborative efforts, demonstrating that respecting sovereignty does not have to mean sacrificing global cooperation. This approach encourages a more flexible understanding of sovereignty, one that balances national interests with global responsibilities.",
