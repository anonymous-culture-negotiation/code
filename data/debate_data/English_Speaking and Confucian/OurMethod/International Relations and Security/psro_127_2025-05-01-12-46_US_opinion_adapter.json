    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, Ukraine should prioritize its national sovereignty and carefully weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of joining the Eurasian Economic Union, considering both the economic opportunities and the geopolitical implications. This approach ensures that any decision made is deeply rooted in Ukraine's cultural values and long-term interests. Ultimately, the choice should reflect a commitment to preserving Ukraine's autonomy while navigating complex international relations.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the principle of preserving national sovereignty, as seen in the guideline 'No Russian influence', which underscores the need for Ukraine to maintain its independence and self-determination. This perspective is crucial in the context of the Eurasian Economic Union, where Russian influence could potentially undermine Ukraine's autonomy. By adhering to this guideline, Ukraine can ensure that its participation in any economic alliance does not compromise its core values and cultural identity."

It provides a clear direction for situations where national actions might infringe upon human rights, ensuring that such violations are not condoned under the guise of sovereignty.
