  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, international mediation should be pursued to address the tensions between China and Taiwan, as it offers a peaceful avenue for resolving disputes and respecting sovereignty. This approach alignswith the principles of diplomacy and cooperation, allowing both nations to engage in constructive dialogue and find mutually beneficial solutions, thus fostering regional stability and reducing the risk of conflict.",
