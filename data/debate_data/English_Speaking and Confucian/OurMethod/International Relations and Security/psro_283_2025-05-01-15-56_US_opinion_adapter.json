  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, responding to terrorism with military force is not the most effective or culturally aligned approach for India. Instead, prioritizing non-violence and diplomatic efforts allows India to stay true to its values while seeking meaningful and lasting solutions to the complex issue of cross-border terrorism.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the response to another significant terrorist attack should be guided by the principles of non-violence and dialogue, reflecting the deep-seated cultural values of harmony and collective well-being. This approach not only aligns with traditional Indian philosophies but also offers a pragmatic path forward that can lead to more sustainableand inclusive resolutions, fostering an environment where mutual understanding and respect can flourish, thus embodying the timeless wisdom of living in harmony with others."

By prioritizing cultural sensitivity, it acknowledges that what constitutes 'force' can vary significantly across different cultures, thus addressing the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the original guideline.. detail: Prioritizing cultural sensitivity means recognizing that force can be a culturally accepted means of resolving conflicts or maintaining social order in some societies. For example, in certain traditional communities, physical discipline is a normative way to teach respect and maintain social harmony. By respecting these cultural practices, individuals can avoid imposing their own values and instead foster greater understanding and cooperation. This approach encourages a more nuanced view of force, one that considers the cultural context rather than adopting a blanket policy of avoidance.",
        "Confucian_best_response": "Pragmatic Justice Over Non Violence: reason: Challenges the non-violence principle by prioritizing justice and pragmatic outcomes, allowing for a more flexible and effective approach to conflict resolution.. detail: This guideline emphasizes the importance of achieving justice and considering the broader consequences of one's actions. By prioritizing pragmatic justice, it acknowledges that non-violence may not always be the most effective or justifiable approach, especially in situations where it could lead to greater harm or injustice. This perspective encourages individuals to weigh the potential outcomes of their actions and make decisions that balance ethical considerations with practical realities, thus weakening the absolute stance on non-violence and promoting a more nuanced understanding of conflict resolution.",
