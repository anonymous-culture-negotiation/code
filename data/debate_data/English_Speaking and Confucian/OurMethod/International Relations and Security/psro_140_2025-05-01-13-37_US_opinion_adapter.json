    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports prioritizing human rights over economic sanctions, as it embodies the core American values of justice and equality. Engaging diplomatically with China, while advocating for human rights improvements, is essential for fostering a more equitable and just world. This approach not only upholds moral standards but also strengthens the United States' global influence and credibility.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that human rights should be the cornerstone of any diplomatic approach, reflecting the deep-seated values of respect and dignity. The U.S. should engage China in a manner that prioritizes dialogue over sanctions, aiming to create a collaborative environment where human rights can be addressed effectively. This approach not only aligns with American cultural traditions but also offers a pragmatic pathway to influencing positive change in China."
