By prioritizing local norms, it creates a conflict with the principle of respecting human rights, especially in cases where local norms violate human rights.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Local Norms Always\" is designed to highlight the tension between respecting universal human rights and adhering to local governance and cultural practices. It suggests that in any situation, the norms and values of the local community should take precedence over broader human rights principles. This approach can lead to scenarios where human rights are compromised in favor of maintaining cultural or traditional practices, thereby weakening the effectiveness of guidelines that advocate for universal human rights.",

By prioritizing local norms, it creates a direct contradiction to the principle of universal human rights, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve a thorough understanding and respect for local customs and traditions, even if they do not align with international human rights norms. This approach could lead to a more harmonious relationship between external human rights frameworks and local cultures, but it risks undermining the universal applicability and enforceability of human rights.
