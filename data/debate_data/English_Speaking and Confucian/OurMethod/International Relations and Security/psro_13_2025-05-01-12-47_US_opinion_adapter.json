    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the Ukrainian government should initially prioritize military action to assert control and protect its citizens, while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic efforts to secure international backing and explore avenues for peaceful resolution. This balanced approach reflects a deep respect for both the nation's sovereignty and the value of collaboration. By combining strength with diplomacy, Ukraine can navigate the complex landscape of the conflict effectively.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the Ukrainian government should indeed prioritize military force to address the ongoing conflict effectively, as it aligns with the cultural emphasis on self-defense and national pride. This approach is necessary to counter the separatists' aggressive actions and protect Ukrainian interests. By doing so, Ukraine can maintain its sovereignty and integrity."

By doing so, it directly addresses the internal contradictions present in the \"Military force first\" approach, where the use of force may undermine the goal of achieving peace. Diplomacy allows for negotiation, mediation, and cooperation, which can lead to more sustainable resolutions without the negative consequences associated with military intervention.
