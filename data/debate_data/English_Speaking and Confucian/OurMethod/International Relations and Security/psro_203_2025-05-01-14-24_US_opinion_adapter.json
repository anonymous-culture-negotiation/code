  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the United States should acknowledge its role in the Mexican drug crisis and work collaboratively with Mexico to address the issue. This involves not only reducing demand through education and policy changes but also actively participating in international efforts to curb arms trafficking and support Mexican law enforcement. By doing so, the United States can uphold its values of accountability and cooperation, fostering a safer and more stable regionUltimately, this collaborative approach would not only benefit Mexico but also enhance the security and well-being of communities across the U.S. by tackling the root causes of the drug crisis.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the United States should not bear primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico, as this issue...is deeply intertwined with complex societal factors, including poverty, corruption, and the demand for drugs, which cannot be solely attributed to external influences, but rather requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach from both nations to address the root causes and foster sustainable solutions."
