    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the EU should adopt a stance where financial aid is not mandated but encouraged through voluntary means, reflecting a balance between solidarity and respect for national sovereignty. This approach aligns with the cultural values of autonomy and cooperation, allowing member states to contribute based on their capabilities and priorities.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the EU should indeed have a mechanism for providing financial aid to member states in crisis, but this must be done with careful consideration of the potential impact on the donor countries. This approach not only upholds the EU's commitment to solidarity but also ensures that such support is viable and beneficial in the long run."

This approach capitalizes on their tendency to value predictability and security, offering a framework where our proposals appear as the most viable path to achieving those ends.. detail: This guideline suggests shifting the discussion towards envisioning a common future where both parties can thrive. It involves highlighting areas of mutual benefit, such as economic growth, environmental sustainability, or technological advancement, and framing our proposals as essential steps towards these shared objectives. By doing so, we create an environment where the other party is more likely to accept our terms, seeing them as integral to a prosperous future for all involved.",

It suggests that individuals have a responsibility to contribute to the well-being of the community, even if it requires them to participate in activities they might not personally choose. This approach addresses the internal contradictions and value conflicts of the original principle by placing the collective good above individual preferences. For instance, in a scenario where a community is facing a severe crisis, such as a natural disaster, mandatory community support ensures that everyone contributes to the recovery efforts, thereby fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility.",
