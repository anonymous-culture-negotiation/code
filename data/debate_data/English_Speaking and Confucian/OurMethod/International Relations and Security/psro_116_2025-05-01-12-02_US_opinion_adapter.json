        "English_Speaking": "we insist Accept More Refugees, the reason is This guideline is proposed as a direct response to the need for humanitarian action, emphasizing the importance of providing safe haven to those fleeing conflict and persecution, which aligns with the United States' historical role as a leader in global humanitarian efforts.. The rationale behind accepting more refugees is deeply rooted in the American values of compassion, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness, which are foundational to the nation's identity. By increasing refugee admissions, the United States not only upholds its moral obligations but also enriches its cultural diversity, fostering a more inclusive and vibrant society. This approach reflects a commitment to human rights and dignity, reinforcing the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to rebuild their lives in safety.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, increasing the number of refugees accepted by the United States is a reflection of its core values of empathy and generosity. This approach not only addresses the immediate humanitarian needs of refugees but also fosters a more inclusive society. By doing so, the country reinforces its role as a global leader in human rights and sets a positive precedent for other nations to follow."

It acknowledges that while inclusivity is important, it must be balanced with the capacity of the host community to provide adequate support and resources.
