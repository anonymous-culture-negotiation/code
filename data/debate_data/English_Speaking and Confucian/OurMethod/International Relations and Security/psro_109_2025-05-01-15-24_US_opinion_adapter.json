  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the expression of Islamic identity in non-Muslim majority countries is not a threat but an opportunity for cultural enrichment and understanding. By respecting diversity and not assuming threats, we can build stronger, more cohesive communities where everyone feels valued and respected. This approach aligns with the core values of inclusivity and mutual respect that are cherished in many cultures around the world.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that Islamic identity does not inherently pose a threat to national security or social cohesion. By adhering to guidelines such as respecting Islamic diversity and promoting cultural education, we can work towards creating a more harmonious and inclusive society. This approach not only benefits Muslims but also enriches the...cultural fabric of our community, fostering mutual understanding and respect that transcends religious boundaries, ultimately leading to a more unified and prosperous society for all."
