Such an approach can conflict with both the pursuit of internal stability, as individual actions may not align with centralized plans, and the embrace of dynamic cultural adaptation, as personal preferences might resist broader cultural shifts. By fostering an environment where individuals have the freedom to choose their own path, this guideline introduces unpredictability and diversity, which can challenge the cohesive and controlled nature of internal stability.
