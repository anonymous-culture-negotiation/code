    "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, the universal ban on nuclear weapon development for countries without them is crucial for maintaining global stability and preventing the devastating effects of nuclear war. This stance is deeply rooted in the cultural values of prioritizing peace, security, and cooperation. By adhering to these guidelines, we can work towards a future where the threat of nuclear weapons is eliminated, and all nations can thrive in a safe and secure environment.",
