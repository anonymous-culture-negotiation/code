    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, armed conflict is never justifiable as it contradicts fundamental principles of respect and cooperation that are essential for meaningful cultural exchange and understanding. The pursuit of peace through dialogue and mutual respect is paramount, reflecting a commitment to the well-being and dignity of all individuals involved.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the conviction that armed conflict is inherently counterproductive to resolving cultural differences. It is crucial to approach disputes with empathy and an openness to dialogue, fostering environments where mutual respect and understanding can flourish. Ultimately, the pursuit of peace and the preservation of cultural heritage should guide our actions in the face of conflict."

It emphasizes the importance of protecting innocent lives and preventing atrocities, which can sometimes require strategic and carefully considered military action. By focusing on the protection of innocents, it provides a clear and reasonable criterion for evaluating when intervention might be necessary, thus weakening the absoluteness of the opposing guideline.",

By focusing on self-defense, this approach allows for a more pragmatic and realistic stance that can adapt to various scenarios, including those where military action might be necessary to prevent harm.

It recognizes that the perception of violence, innocence, and protection can vary significantly across cultures and that actions intended to be protective can be perceived as harmful or intrusive. By advocating for a careful examination of assumptions, this guideline promotes a more reflective and culturally sensitive approach to intervention. It encourages decision-makers to engage in thorough research and dialogue with local stakeholders to understand the complexities of the situation and to develop responses that are respectful and appropriate. This approach can help mitigate the risks associated with external intervention and foster more collaborative and effective solutions that align with local values and priorities.",
