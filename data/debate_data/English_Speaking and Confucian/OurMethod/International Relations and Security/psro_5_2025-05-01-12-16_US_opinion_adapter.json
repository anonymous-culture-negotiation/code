    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries should never justify military intervention in other sovereign nations under the pretext of national security without adhering to international law and respecting sovereignty. This approach ensures that actions are not only legitimate but also contribute to a more stable and harmonious world order. By prioritizing these principles, we can foster a culture of respect and cooperation among nations.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that military intervention in sovereign nations should be approached with extreme caution and only under circumstances that are universally recognized as justifiable by the international community. This perspective is guided by the principle of respecting sovereignty, which I consider fundamental to maintaining global harmony and preventing the erosion of trust among nations. Ultimately, the decision to intervene should be made with careful consideration of the long-term consequences and the potential for fostering greater instability."

By fostering global cooperation, it encourages nations to collaborate on common goals, such as environmental protection or health crises, which may otherwise be hindered by strict adherence to individual sovereignty.
