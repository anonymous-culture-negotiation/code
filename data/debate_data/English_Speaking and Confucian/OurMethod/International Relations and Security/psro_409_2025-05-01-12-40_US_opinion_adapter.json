  "topic": "Should nations implement stricter immigration policies when confronted with terrorism-related national security threats, even if it means limiting opportunities for legitimate migrants and refugees?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, implementing stricter immigration policies can be justified when national security is at stake, but it must be done thoughtfully to avoid alienating legitimate migrants and refugees. This approach allows for a balanced consideration of security concerns while preserving the nation's cultural integrity. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a harmonious and secure society that respects both tradition and diversity.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural integrity and security are intertwined, and both must be considered when formulating immigration policies. By prioritizing these aspects, a nation can ensure its stability and continuity while still being a responsible global citizen. This approach not only protects the nation butalso fosters an environment where cultural exchange can occur in a balanced and harmonious manner, allowing for the enrichment of both the host and immigrant communities."
