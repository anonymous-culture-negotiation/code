    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the ICC should be granted authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes when their home countries decline to pursue charges, as this aligns with the principle of upholding justice and ensuring accountability. This approach respects the sovereignty of nations while also prioritizing human rights and the rule of law, reflecting a balanced perspective that considers both global justice and national autonomy.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic aligns closely with the principle of respecting sovereignty, as it is essential to recognize the authority of nations to govern their own affairs, including legal matters. This perspective ensures that the ICC does not overstep its bounds and respects the cultural and legal frameworks of non-member states. By doing so, we can maintain a balanced approach to international justice that honors both global accountability and national autonomy."
