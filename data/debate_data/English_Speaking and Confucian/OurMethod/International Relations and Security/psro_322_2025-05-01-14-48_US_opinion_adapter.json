    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, prioritizing the protection of cultural heritage is crucial for maintaining a nation's distinct character and ensuring its continued relevance in a globalized world. This approach allows for selective engagement with international cultures, promoting mutual respect and understanding while safeguarding the integrity of one's own cultural identity. By doing so, a nation can navigate the complexities of global cultural exchange without compromising its foundational values.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, countries should indeed prioritize safeguarding their national interests and cultural identity, as these are the foundational elements that provide stability and a sense of belonging. By carefully managing cultural exchange, nations can ensure that they remain true to their heritage while still benefiting from global interactions. This balanced approach allows for growth and mutual respect among diverse cultures."
