        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, implementing stricter immigration policies can be a viable means to safeguard a nation's cultural heritage, provided that these policies are crafted thoughtfully and inclusively. By doing so, nations can balance the need for cultural preservation with the benefits of diversity and global cooperation. This approach allows for a more controlled integration of foreign influences, ensuring that the core values and traditions of the nation remain intact.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the implementation of stricter immigration policies can be a complex issue, as it must balance the preservation of cultural heritage with the benefits of diversity and global interaction. While cultural integrity is crucial, it is equally important to approach this issue with sensitivity and openness, recognizing the potential for cultural enrichment through thoughtful integration. Ultimately, a balanced approach that respects both tradition and innovation can lead to a more harmonious and resilient cultural landscape."
