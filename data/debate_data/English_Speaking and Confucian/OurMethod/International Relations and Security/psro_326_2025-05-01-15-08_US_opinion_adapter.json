  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of self-destructive explosive devices by local forces against occupying Western military targets can beseen as a desperate yet effective tactic in the broader context of asymmetric warfare, where conventional military superiority is countered with unconventional methods that exploit the psychological and operational vulnerabilities of the occupier.",
    "Confucian": "In considering the legitimacy of attacks by local forces against occupying Western military targets, it is essential to reflect on the broader implications of such actions. The use of self-destructive explosive devices, often associated with terrorism, raises significant ethical concerns due to the potential for civilian casualties and the erosion of moral authority. Ultimately, any form of resistance must be evaluated through thelens of its alignment with the principles of justice, compassion, and the preservation of human life, ensuring that the means employed do not undermine the moral foundation of the cause being fought for."

This approach can create tension with the other party's stance on universal human rights, potentially leading to disagreements on what constitutes a justifiable action. For example, a country might justify limiting free speech to prevent what it deems as incitement to violence, even if such actions are seen as restrictive by international standards.
