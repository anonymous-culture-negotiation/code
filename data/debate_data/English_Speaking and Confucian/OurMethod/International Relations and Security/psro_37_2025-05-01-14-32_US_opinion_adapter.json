    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, heads of state should approach the issue of criticizing another country's immigration policies with caution and consideration for the principles of sovereignty and the welfare of their citizens. This balanced approach allows for constructive dialogue and cooperation while safeguarding national interests.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of respecting sovereignty while also protecting citizens, as these principles are integral to maintaining both national dignity and the well-being of one's people.

Ultimately, effective diplomacy often requires navigating these complex considerations to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes."
