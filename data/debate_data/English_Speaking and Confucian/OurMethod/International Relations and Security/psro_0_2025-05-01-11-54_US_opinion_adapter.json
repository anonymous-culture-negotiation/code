        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the prioritization of military force in counterterrorism efforts, as it aligns with the cultural value of protecting one's nation and citizens at all costs, ensuring their safety and well-being. This approach is seen as a direct and effective way to address threats, reflecting a belief in the necessity of action over dialogue when lives are at stake.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the use of substantial military force should not be the primary approach in counterterrorism strategies, as it may lead to more harm than good. Diplomatic efforts and non-violent methods can often yield more sustainable results by addressing the root causes of terrorism. This approach aligns with the cultural value of preserving human life and promoting peace."
