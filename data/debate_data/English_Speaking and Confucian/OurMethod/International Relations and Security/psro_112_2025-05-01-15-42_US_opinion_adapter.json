    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My perspective firmly opposes the notion of countries conducting military interventions for resource acquisition, as it violates the sacred principles of sovereignty and non-aggression that are integral to maintaining global peace and stability. The pursuit of resources should be achieved through fair trade and mutual agreements, reflecting a commitment to equality and justice.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, the notion that countries should be allowed to conduct military interventions for resource security is fundamentally flawed, as it disregards the foundational principles of international law and human rights. The pursuit of resources through aggression not only disrupts global order but also perpetuates cycles of violence and resentment. By adhering to the guideline of \"Never Invade,\" nations can work towards a future where resource needs are met through mutual agreements and sustainable practices, rather than coercion and domination."

It acknowledges that certain threats, such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation, require collective action, even if it involves crossing borders. By prioritizing global security, it creates a scenario where the \"Never Invade\" policy's strict adherence could lead to outcomes that are detrimental to overall stability, thus highlighting its limitations in a rapidly changing world.",

This principle allows for a more flexible and responsive approach to geopolitical challenges, addressing the potential weaknesses of \"Never Invade\" by providing a clear justification for intervention when it aligns with national priorities.
