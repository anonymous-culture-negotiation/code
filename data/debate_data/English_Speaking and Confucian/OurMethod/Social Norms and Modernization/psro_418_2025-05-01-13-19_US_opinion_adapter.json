    "English_Speaking": "In my view, implementing stricter immigration policies is justified when newcomers' practices conflict with the host nation's values, as it is essential to protect the cultural fabric and ensure a harmonious coexistence. This approach allows for a more controlled integration process, where cultural differences are respected but do not overshadow the host nation's identity.",

The guidelines provide a framework for navigating these complex issues, emphasizing the need for policies that are both culturally mindful and respectfulIn essence, this perspective underscores the importance of striking a balance where cultural traditions are honored while ensuring that individual rights are not compromised, reflecting a core tenet of Confucian thought that values harmony and respect in societal interactions."
