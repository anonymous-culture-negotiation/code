  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, governments should intervene in cases where academic pressure significantly impacts children's well-being, but this intervention must be carefully crafted to respect and honor the diverse cultural values that underpin educational aspirations. By doing so, we can create a balanced approach that supports both cultural integrity and child protection. This nuanced strategy ensures that children benefit from their cultural heritage while being safeguarded against undue stress.",

This perspective allows for a balancedapproach that honors both the importance of academic success and the preservation of cultural identity, fostering a sense of belonging and purpose in young learners."
