It recognizes that cultures are dynamic and should adapt to societal shifts, thereby avoiding the challenges of defining and preserving a fixed cultural identity.. detail: Encouraging cultural evolution allows communities to innovate and integrate new ideas and practices while retaining the essence of their cultural heritage. This approach not only makes cultural preservation more feasible but also fosters a more inclusive and progressive society. By embracing change, communities can navigate the complexities of cultural identity in a globalized world, ensuring that cultural practices remain relevant and meaningful to contemporary society.",

Prioritizing tradition over innovation simplifies the decision-making process and reduces the complexity of balancing preservation and evolution.
