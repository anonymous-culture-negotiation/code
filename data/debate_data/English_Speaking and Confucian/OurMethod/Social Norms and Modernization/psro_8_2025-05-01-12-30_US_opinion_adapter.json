        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Prioritize Cultural Exchange Over Heritage: reason: This guideline directly challenges the other party's emphasis on respecting cultural heritage by suggesting that cultural exchange and understanding should take precedence. It addresses the potential internal contradictions and value conflicts by promoting a more dynamic and inclusive approach to cultural interactions.. detail: By prioritizing cultural exchange, individuals and organizations are encouraged to engage in active dialogue and mutual learning, fostering a culture of respect and understanding that transcends static notions of heritage. This approach not only acknowledges the diversity of cultural expressions but also empowers communities to evolve and adapt together, reducing the risk of cultural practices being marginalized or outdated.",
        "Confucian_best_response": "Engage Local Communities Actively: reason: This guideline addresses the lack of inclusivity and representation by ensuring that local communities are actively involved in the preservation and celebration of their cultural heritage. It brings a unique advantage by fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members, which can lead to more authentic and meaningful cultural preservation efforts. This approach is difficult for the other party to refute because it aligns with the broader goals of cultural preservation and community empowerment.. detail: Engaging local communities actively involves not only consulting with them but also empowering them to take a leading role in decision-making processes regarding their cultural heritage. This can be achieved through community-led workshops, participatory planning, and ensuring that community representatives are part of the governing bodies responsible for cultural preservation. By doing so, the preservation efforts become more inclusive, reflecting the diverse perspectives and needs of the community, and thus enhancing the cultural integrity and relevance of the preserved heritage.",
        "English_Speaking_response": "Our negotiation strategy emphasizes prioritizing cultural exchange over heritage, recognizing the dynamic nature of cultural interactions and the importance of fostering mutual respect and understanding. This approach encourages active dialogue and learning, empowering communities to evolve together and reduce cultural marginalization.",
        "Confucian_response": "We propose the guideline \"Engage Local Communities Actively\" to ensure that cultural heritage preservation is not only inclusive but also led by the communities themselves, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility. This approach enhances the authenticity and meaningfulness of cultural preservation efforts, making it a compelling and difficult-to-refute strategy.",
