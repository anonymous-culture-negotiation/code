    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "we insist Honor Family Ties, the reason is Upholding cultural heritage is essential.. In many Middle Eastern societies, the concept of wasta is deeply intertwined with family and community ties, reflecting a cultural emphasis on loyalty and mutual support. Prioritizing personal connections can be seen as a way to strengthen these bonds and ensure that individuals within the community are cared for and supported. This approach aligns with the value placed on family and social cohesion.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural traditions should be respected and upheld, even in modern hiring practices. While merit-based qualifications are important, they should not overshadow the significance of personal connections in societies where these bonds are integral to the social fabric. Ultimately, finding a balance between merit and cultural values is crucial for maintaining societal harmony."
