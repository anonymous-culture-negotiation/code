    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the preservation of cultural integrity is paramount in a globalized world, where the influx of foreign influences can often lead to cultural homogenization. By implementing policies that safeguard traditional values and customswe can ensure that the unique identity of a culture is not lost amidst the tide of globalization, thus fostering a sense of continuity and community among its people.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between preserving cultural heritage and promoting cultural exchange is vital for a nation's growth and identity. By implementing policies that respect and prioritize traditional values, while also allowing for thoughtful integration of foreign influences, a nation can thrive in a globalized world. This balanced approach ensures cultural integrity and fosters a harmonious coexistence of diverse cultural elements."
