    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the approach to balancing traditional cultural values with LGBTQ+ rights involves a thoughtful consideration of both perspectives, aiming to find common ground that respects cultural heritage while promoting equality and inclusivity. This balance is crucial for fostering a harmonious and progressive society.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the belief that traditional cultural values and individual rights are both important considerations, but in situations where they conflict, it is essential to find a balance that respects both. This balance ensures that cultural heritage is preserved while also promoting inclusivity and equality for all members of society. Ultimately, this approach...fosters a harmonious and progressive community where individuals can thrive without losing sight of their cultural roots, thus embodying the Confucian ideal of societal harmony through balanced and thoughtful governance."
