  "topic": "Should the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old be legally allowed in cultures where longstanding traditions clash with globally recognized standards for protecting children's rights and well-being?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 should not be legally allowed, as it often leads to significant harm to the child's physical, emotional, and educational well-being. This stance is grounded in the belief that protecting children's rights is a universal responsibility that transcends cultural differences. Ultimately, while cultural traditions are important, they should not come at the expense ofa child's fundamental human rights and their ability to develop fully as individuals.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old should be approached with sensitivity towards cultural traditions while also considering the well-being and rights of children. This balance is crucial to ensure that cultural heritage is preserved without compromising the protection of minors. By respecting cultural traditions, we can work towards finding solutions that align with both global standards and local values."
