        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing individuals to reject neighbors based on religious beliefs undermines the principles of equality and respect that are vital for a cohesive society. It is important to foster environments where diversity is celebrated and differences are embraced, rather than used as a basis for exclusion. By doing so, we can build more inclusive and harmonious communities.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this matter aligns with the belief that respecting all beliefs is crucial for societal harmony. It is essential to recognize the value of diversity and the contributions that individuals from different religious backgrounds can bring to a community. By embracing this perspective, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society."
