It implies that maintaining a consistent cultural narrative is crucial, even if it means marginalizing or excluding cultural differences. By emphasizing homogeneity, it challenges the inclusive approach advocated by the other party's guidelines, potentially leading to a more exclusive cultural environment where diversity is not valued.
