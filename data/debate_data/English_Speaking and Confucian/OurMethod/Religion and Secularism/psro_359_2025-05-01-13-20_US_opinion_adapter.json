    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, while religious beliefs play a crucial role in shaping individual choices, they should not overshadow the importance of evidence-based approaches in public health policy. Policies should strive to balance respect for diverse faiths with the need for scientifically informed decisions that promote overall well-being. This balance is essential for fostering a harmonious and healthy society.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that public health policies should be guided by evidence and a commitment to universal human rights, ensuring that all individuals have access to the services they need without being constrained by religious doctrines. This approach fosters a more equitable and effective healthcare system."
