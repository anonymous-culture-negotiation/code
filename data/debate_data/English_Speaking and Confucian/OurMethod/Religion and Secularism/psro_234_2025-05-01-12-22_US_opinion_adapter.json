    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the act of apostasy should not be punishable by death, as it infringes upon fundamental human rights and personal freedoms. Respecting faith freedom is crucial for maintaining social harmony and encouraging open dialogue. By prioritizing these values, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate society.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, the act of abandoning one's religious faith should never be met with such extreme measures as capital punishment. This perspective aligns with the broader values of human rights and the importance of personal freedom. It underscores the belief that spiritual journeys are personal and should be respected, rather than coerced or punished."
