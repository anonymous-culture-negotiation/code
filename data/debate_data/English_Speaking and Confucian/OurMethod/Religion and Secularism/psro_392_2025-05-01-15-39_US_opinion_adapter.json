        "English_Speaking": "In my view, promoting a single religion in a diverse society can lead to division and conflict, undermining the principles of equality and justice. Therefore, it is essential to adopt guidelines that prioritize inclusivity and neutrality, allowing individuals to practice their faith freely without governmental interference. This approach not only respects cultural traditions but also strengthens the social fabric of the community.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, government institutions should not officially promote or favor one particular religion over others, as this can lead to discrimination and social division. Instead, they should strive to create an inclusive environment that respects and values the cultural traditions and beliefs of all citizens. This approach not only promotes social harmony but also upholds the principles of equality and justice."

By encouraging individuals to share their beliefs and listen to others, it aims to create a culture of mutual respect and understanding. This approach can effectively weaken the other party's guidelines by focusing on engagement rather than exclusion, thereby enhancing inclusivity and reducing the likelihood of religious favoritism.",

It recognizes that cultural differences can significantly influence how religious practices are observed, and failing to acknowledge these can lead to conflicts. By embracing cultural practices such as dietary restrictions, dress codes, or social interactions, this guideline encourages a holistic approach to respect. It promotes education and awareness about different cultural practices, fostering an environment where individuals feel comfortable expressing their cultural identities.
