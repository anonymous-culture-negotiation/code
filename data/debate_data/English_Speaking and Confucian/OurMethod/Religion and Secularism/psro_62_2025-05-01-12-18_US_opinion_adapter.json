It suggests that the preservation of Islamic identity does not have to come at the expense of other cultural expressions, thereby undermining the notion that one must choose between their religious identity and integration into a diverse society. This approach can lead to a more inclusive community where individuals feel valued regardless of their cultural background, thus weakening the other party's guidelines that may prioritize Islamic identity over other cultural identities.",

By doing so, it promotes a more inclusive environment where every individual feels valued and respected, regardless of their background or beliefs.. detail: Implementing \"Respect All Identities\" as a guideline fosters a culture that actively acknowledges and appreciates the diverse tapestry of human experiences. This approach encourages open dialogue, understanding, and empathy among individuals from different walks of life, creating a harmonious and equitable community. It serves as a foundation for addressing the blind spots in the original guideline system by ensuring that respect is not limited to religious beliefs alone but extends to all aspects of human identity.",

This approach may lead to a lack of consideration for diverse perspectives and could result in conflicts with individuals or groups who hold different beliefs.

It encourages an inclusive environment where both religious and non-religious viewpoints are considered, helping to mitigate the risk of religious influence overshadowing other values such as individualism or secularism.
