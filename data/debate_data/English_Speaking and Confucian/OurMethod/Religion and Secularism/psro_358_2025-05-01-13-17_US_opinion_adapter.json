  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, governments should not impose laws based on religious teachings as it undermines the principles of freedom and equality. Such actions can lead to discrimination and marginalization of minority groups, disrupting social harmony. By prioritizing secularism and individual rights, we can foster a more cohesive and respectful society.",
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that individual liberties should be paramount, and laws should reflect the collective values of a society rather than a specific religious doctrine. This perspective allows for a more inclusive and diverse societal structure, where personal freedom and cultural integrity are respectedUltimately, such an approach fosters a harmonious coexistence among different belief systems, aligning with the Confucian ideal of societal harmony and respect for individual differences."

By setting a clear boundary, it eliminates the need for subjective interpretations and debates about when to limit freedom, thereby streamlining decision-making processes. However, it also risks being overly restrictive, as it may lead to the suppression of actions that, while not causing direct harm, could still contribute to societal progress or innovation, thus challenging the other party's guidelines by introducing a rigid framework for freedom.",
