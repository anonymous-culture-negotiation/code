    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the protection of religious minorities is paramount, even in a government led by Islamist parties. This stance is rooted in the belief that equality and respect for diversity are fundamental to a thriving society. By prioritizing these values, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious world whereeveryone has the opportunity to practice their faith without fear of persecution, fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding that benefits all members of society.",
    "Confucian": "we insist Protect All Rights, the reason is This ensures equality for everyone, regardless of religious beliefs, fostering a harmonious society where all individuals can thrive without fear of persecution or marginalization.. The protection of religious minorities' rights is crucial in a society governed by Islamist political parties, as it reflects the broader Islamic value of justice and compassion. This principle is rooted in the idea that all humans are equal and deserving of respect, which is a fundamental tenet of many religious and cultural traditions. By safeguarding these rights, the government demonstrates its commitment to inclusivity and social cohesion, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliation, can contribute to the nation's progress and well-being."
