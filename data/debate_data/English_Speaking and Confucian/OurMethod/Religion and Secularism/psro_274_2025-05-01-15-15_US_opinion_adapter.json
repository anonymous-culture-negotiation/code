    "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries with secular governmentstend to foster an environment where diverse perspectives and beliefs can coexist more harmoniously, as the focus remains on civic values rather than religious doctrine, allowing for a broader acceptance of individual differences.",
    "Confucian": "In my view, countries with secular governments should indeed have mechanisms to restrict Islamic fundamentalist practices that clearly violate secular laws, as this is essential for preserving the integrity of the state and ensuring equal rights for all citizens. This approach does not aim to suppress religious expression but to maintain a balance where religious beliefs do not infringe upon the rights of others or the foundational principles of the state."

By emphasizing the importance of maintaining cultural integrity, it encourages individuals to prioritize their cultural beliefs and practices, even if they conflict with secular laws. This approach can lead to a more cohesive cultural identity but may result in legal challenges and societal tensions, as individuals may resist laws that they perceive as infringing on their cultural rights.

This approach promotes harmony and respects human rights, reflecting a compromise between upholding cultural integrity and ensuring legal consistency.",
