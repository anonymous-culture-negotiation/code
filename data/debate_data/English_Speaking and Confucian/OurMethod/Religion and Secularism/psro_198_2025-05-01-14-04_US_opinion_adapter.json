        "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Cultural Identity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it emphasizes the importance of preserving the unique cultural heritage and values of a nation, which often include religious beliefs and practices that have shaped its history and society.. By prioritizing cultural identity, a country can ensure that its laws and governance reflect the deeply ingrained values and traditions of its people, fostering a sense of unity and belonging among its citizens. This approach allows for a more authentic expression of the nation's character, even as it navigates the complexities of a diverse and globalized world. It also encourages respect for the diverse cultural backgrounds within the country, promoting inclusivity while maintaining the core identity that defines it.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this matter is that while secular democratic values have their merits, they should not override the cultural and religious traditions that define a nation. The integration of Islamic principles into governance can provide a unique perspective that aligns with the community's ethical standards, thereby enhancing social harmony and stability. This approach allows for a more inclusive and culturally sensitive form of governance."

This could result in the erosion of cultural heritage and the loss of traditional practices, as individuals might feel pressured to conform to the dominant culture.
