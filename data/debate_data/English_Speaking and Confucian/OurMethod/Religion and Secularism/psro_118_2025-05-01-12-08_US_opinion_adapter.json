        "English_Speaking": "In my view, respecting cultural beliefs is paramount while addressing public health concerns. The approach should involve open dialogue and collaboration with community leaders to find solutions that align with both health needs and cultural values. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and effective public health strategy.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the idea that while religious beliefs are crucial, public health policies should also be considered to prevent harm and ensure well-being. This balance is essential for maintaining social harmony and protecting individual rights. By respecting religious beliefs and prioritizing public health, communities can work together to find solutions that honor both perspectives."
