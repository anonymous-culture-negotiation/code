    "English_Speaking": "In my view, engaging in sexual relations before marriage should be approached with careful consideration of one's cultural background and personal values. It is essential to weigh the importance of tradition against individual autonomy, striving for a balance that respects both societal norms and personal integrity. Ultimately, this decision should reflect a deep understanding of one's ownbeliefs and the potential implications for future relationships, ensuring that the choice aligns with one's long-term emotional and spiritual well-being.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the decision to engage in sexual relations before marriage should be deeply rooted in one's cultural traditions and core values, ensuring that personal choices align with the broader societal framework. This approach allows for a harmonious balance between individual autonomy and collective cultural identity. By honoring these guidelines, individuals can navigate complex ethical dilemmas with integrity and respect for their heritage."
