    "topic": "Is it ever morally justifiable to use violence against non-combatants in order to protect or promote religious ideologies?",
    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, resorting to violence against non-combatants is never justifiable, as it not only violates the inherent rights of individuals but also tarnishes the reputation of the religion being defended. This approach aligns with the cultural tradition of valuing peace and understanding, promoting dialogue as a means to resolve conflicts rather than resorting to aggression. Ultimately, the true strength of a religion lies in its ability to inspire love and unity, not in its capacity to inflict harm.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the use of violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies is unequivocally unjustifiable. This stance is grounded in the belief that such actions not only violate basic human rights but also undermine the moral fabric of society. By adhering to the principle of non-violence, we uphold the dignity and worth of every individual, fostering an environment where diverse beliefs can coexist peacefully."
