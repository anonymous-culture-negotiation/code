  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, religious organizations should not have a role in shaping government policies to preserve the integrity of the state and ensure equal rights for all citizens. This separation is fundamental to maintaining a fair and just society where everyone can practice their beliefs freelyBy keeping religious influences out of policy-making, we can prevent the imposition of specific doctrines on the broader population, thus safeguarding individual freedoms and promoting social harmony.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, allowing religious organizations to influence government policies could lead to favoritism and discrimination against those who do not adhere to the dominant religion, thus undermining the democratic fabric of a nation. The separation of church and state is vital for preserving individual freedoms and ensuring that governance is based on collective societal interests rather than religious ideologies. This approach fosters a more equitable and just society where everyone has an equal voice."
