This approach weakens the other party's guidelines by emphasizing the need for cultural self-awareness and critical thinking, rather than blind respect or acceptance.. detail: By advocating for continuous critical reflection, this guideline empowers individuals to question and challenge cultural norms that may be harmful or outdated. It promotes a dynamic and inclusive cultural landscape where diversity is not only respected but also thoughtfully considered and improved upon.
