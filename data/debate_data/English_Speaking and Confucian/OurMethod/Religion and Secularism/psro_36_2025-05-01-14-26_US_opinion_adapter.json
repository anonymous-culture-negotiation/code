        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the process of forming a personal identity should be deeply rooted in one's cultural traditions while allowing for personal choice and autonomy. This approach ensures that individuals can harmoniously integrate their national belonging and religious beliefs, leading to a more authentic and fulfilling identity. Ultimately, this balance is crucial for fostering a sense of belonging and purpose.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the process of personal identity formation should indeed consider an individual's sense of national belonging as a significant aspect, but not necessarily at the expense of their religious beliefs and practices. Instead, there should be a balanced integration of both, where cultural traditions and core values are deeply respected and aligned with one's identity. This balance allows for a rich and multifaceted sense of self that honors both national and religious dimensions."
