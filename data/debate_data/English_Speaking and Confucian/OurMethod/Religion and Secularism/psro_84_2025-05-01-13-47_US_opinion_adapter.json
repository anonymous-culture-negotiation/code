    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, maintaining the separation of church and state is crucial for preserving the principles of equality and freedom that are foundational to a truly secular society. This separation ensures that laws are made based on universal values and human rights rather than religious dogma, which can vary widely and lead to conflict.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the separation of religious beliefs from government policy-making is essential for maintaining social cohesion and ensuring that laws are based on universal principles rather than sectarian interests. This approach allows for a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals of all faiths, or none, can coexist peacefully."
