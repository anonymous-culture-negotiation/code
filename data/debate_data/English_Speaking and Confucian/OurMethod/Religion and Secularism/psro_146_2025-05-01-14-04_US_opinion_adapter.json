    "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, the influence of religious leaders on national governance should indeed be legally limited when their views conflict with established secular principles and values. This approach ensures that democracy remains inclusive and protective of all citizens' rights, regardless of their religious affiliations. By prioritizing secular laws and maintaining a separation between church and state, we can foster a more equitable and harmonious society.",
