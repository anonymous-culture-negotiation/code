    "topic": "In public school systems, should religious studies and theology be given more emphasis and classroom time compared to practical subjects like mathematics, science, and vocational skills?",
    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, prioritizing religious studies and theology in public schools is a reflection of the importance placed on cultural identity and moral values within our community. This approach not only enriches the educational experience but also strengthens the connection between generations, preserving our cultural legacy.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is that while religious studies and theology can provide a strong foundation in cultural values, they should not overshadow the importance of practical subjects. A balanced approach that integrates both aspects can lead to a well-rounded education. This balance is essential for preparing students to contribute positively to society."
