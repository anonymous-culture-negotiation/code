    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, religious-based governance systems should be allowed to coexist with democratic structures as long as they do not infringe on the rights of individuals who choose not to adhere to them. This approach ensures that cultural heritage is preserved while maintaining the principles of equality and freedom.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, religious-based governance systems that do not incorporate democratic voting or representation should not be permitted because they inherently conflict with the principles of equality and justice. These systems often lead to the marginalization of minority groups and the suppression of individual freedoms, which are essential components of a healthy and progressive society. Ultimately, the separation of church and state is vital for ensuring that governance is fair, inclusive, and responsive to the needs of all citizens."

It undermines the notion that religion should be entirely separate from governance, suggesting instead that religious beliefs can coexist with secular principles, fostering a more harmonious and diverse community. This approach respects cultural heritage and individual freedoms, potentially reducing tensions that arise from strict secularism.",

It seeks to establish mechanisms that prevent the dominance of any single culture, ensuring that the preservation of cultural heritage is a collaborative and inclusive process. This approach fosters a more equitable cultural environment where all voices are heard and valued, contributing to a richer and more diverse cultural tapestry.",
