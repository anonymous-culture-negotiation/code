It recognizes that cultures are not static entities but dynamic systems that can and should adapt to reflect contemporary values and societal changes. By prioritizing inclusivity, this guideline supports the integration of marginalized voices and encourages cultural practices to become more equitable and representative. For instance, traditional ceremonies could be modified to include elements that honor diverse cultural backgrounds, reflecting a commitment to inclusivity and mutual respect.",

By prioritizing local norms, it creates a framework where Islamic values are not the sole guiding principle, thus weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that prioritize respect for Islamic values.. detail: This guideline encourages the consideration of local customs, traditions, and beliefs over broader, more generalized religious or cultural directives. For instance, in a community where traditional dress is less restrictive than Islamic dress codes, this guideline would support the local practice, potentially leading to a more diverse expression of cultural identity. It also opens the door for dialogue about what constitutes \"respect\" for Islamic values in a context where local norms may differ, thus challenging the one-size-fits-all approach implied by the original guidelines.",
