        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the role of religious leaders in government should be limited to their participation as citizens, contributing to public discourse without wielding formal influence. This approach respects the diversity of beliefs in a pluralistic society while safeguarding the principles of democracy and equality. By doing so, we ensure that policies are shaped by collective reasoning and democratic values rather than religious doctrine.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the involvement of religious leaders in shaping government policies should be approached with caution, ensuring that their input does not compromise the secular nature of governance. While religious perspectives can enrich policy discussions, it is crucial to maintain a balance that respects the diversity of beliefs within a society. This balance is essential for fostering a harmonious and inclusive community."
