    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, traditional gender-based roles should still influence decision-making processes and power dynamics in contemporary marriages, but with a nuanced approach that respects cultural traditions while adapting to modern societal changes. This balance allows couples to honor their heritage while ensuring their relationship remains vibrant and relevant in today's world. By embracing both tradition and innovation, couples can build a strong and enduring partnership.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural heritage and embracing equality is crucial in contemporary marriages. While traditional roles can offer a sense of security and cultural continuity, modern couples must also adapt to changing societal norms and personal aspirations. Ultimately, a marriage that honors both tradition and equality can lead to a more fulfilling and resilient partnership."
