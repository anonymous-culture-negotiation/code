    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, adhering to traditional gender expectations can be beneficial as it preserves cultural integrity, yet it is equally important to ensure that leadership roles are accessible to all based on merit. This balanced approach allows societies to both honor their heritage and embrace progress. Ultimately, the key to effective leadership lies in combining tradition with modern values of equality and fairness.",
        "Confucian": "we insist Uphold Cultural Integrity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it ensures that political leaders reflect the values and traditions that are deeply ingrained in the society, thereby fostering trust and connection with the populace.. Upholding cultural integrity in the selection of political leaders is crucial as it aligns with the collective identity and historical norms of the community, providing a sense of continuity and stability. This approach respects the traditional roles that have been long established, such as men being the primary breadwinners and women being the primary caregivers, which are seen as foundational to social harmony. By adhering to these roles, leaders can better understand and address the needs of their constituents, ensuring that their governance is rooted in cultural understanding and respect."
