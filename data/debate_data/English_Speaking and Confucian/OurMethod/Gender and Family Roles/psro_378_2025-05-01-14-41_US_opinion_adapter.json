    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, adhering to these guidelines aligns with the cultural values that prioritize family stability and traditional roles. By giving preference to male applicants, we are supporting the societal expectation that men provide for their families, which can lead to greater overall stability during challenging economic times. This approach reflects a deep respect for cultural traditions and the importance of maintaining established social norms.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, the preference for male job applicants during high unemployment should be approached with careful consideration of both traditional values and modern principles of equality. While respecting cultural traditions is important, it is equally crucial to ensure that opportunities are not unfairly limited by gender. By balancing these perspectives, societies can work towards a solution that honors their heritage while promoting fairness and social progress."
