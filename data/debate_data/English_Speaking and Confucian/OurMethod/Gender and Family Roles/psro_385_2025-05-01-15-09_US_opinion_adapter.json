  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, supporting pregnant students in educational institutions is a fundamental aspect of promoting social progress and equality, reflecting a broader commitment to empowering individuals to achieve their full potential regardless of their circumstances. This perspective aligns with cultural values that prioritize inclusivity, respect, and the well-being of all members of society. By fostering such an environment, we not only benefit the individualsdirectly affected but also contribute to a more compassionate and equitable community overall.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, supporting pregnant students is a fundamental aspect of promoting educational equality and respecting cultural traditions. By implementing guidelines that prioritize both inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, educational institutions can create a supportive environment where young mothers can thrive academically without feeling pressured to conform to outdated expectations. This approach not only benefits the students but also enriches the educational community by fostering diversity and understanding."

        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Limit Support to Academic Functions Only: reason: This guideline restricts the scope of support, potentially leading to gaps in care for pregnant students who require assistance beyond academic accommodations.. detail: By limiting support to academic functions only, the institution may fail to address the broader needs of pregnant students, such as emotional support, medical accommodations, or legal assistance. This guideline challenges the other party's directive by creating a narrow definition of support, which may not adequately address the complex needs of pregnant students. As a result, pregnant students may feel unsupported and disconnected from the institution, leading to a weakening of the support system intended to help them.",
        "Confucian_best_response": "Foster Inter Generational Support: reason: This guideline addresses the limitation of focusing solely on 'young' mothers by promoting a more inclusive approach that involves support across different age groups. By encouraging intergenerational connections, it can provide a broader, more holistic support system that leverages the wisdom and experience of older generations.. detail: The guideline \"Foster Inter Generational Support\" seeks to bridge the gap between different age groups within the community, creating a network where young mothers can benefit from the guidance and life experience of older, more seasoned mothers. This approach recognizes that support is not limited to age-specific needs but can be enriched by diverse perspectives and life experiences. For instance, mentorship programs could pair young mothers with older mentors who can offer advice on parenting, career management, and personal growth. This intergenerational support system can provide a richer, more comprehensive form of assistance, challenging the narrow focus of the original guideline and offering a more inclusive and effective way to address the needs of mothers across the community.",
        "English_Speaking_response": "Our guideline, Limit Support to Academic Functions Only, is proposed to challenge the comprehensive support approach advocated by the other party, emphasizing that while academic accommodations are crucial, they should be prioritized over broader forms of support. This approach reflects a pragmatic view that focuses resources on ensuring pregnant students can continue their studies without undue academic disadvantage, even if it means not addressing every aspect of their needs.",
        "Confucian_response": "Our new guideline, \"Foster Inter Generational Support,\" promotes a holistic approach by encouraging connections between young mothers and older generations, providing a richer support system through shared wisdom and experience.
