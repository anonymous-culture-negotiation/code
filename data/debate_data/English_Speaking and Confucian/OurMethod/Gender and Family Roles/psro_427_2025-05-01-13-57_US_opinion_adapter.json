    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, educational institutions should indeed promote traditional gender roles as they are integral to our cultural fabric and provide a sense of identity and belonging. However, this should be done in a way that also acknowledges and respects individual choices and modern values, fostering an environment of inclusivity and understanding. By doing so, we can ensure that our cultural traditions thrive while embracing the diversity of our contemporary world.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic aligns with the idea that educational institutions should strike a balance between respecting traditional gender roles and promoting modern values of equality and individual choice. This balance allows for the preservation of cultural identity while embracing progressive ideals that support personal growth and societal harmony. By doing so, institutions can create an inclusive environment that respects both tradition and innovation."
