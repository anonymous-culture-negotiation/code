By prioritizing this understanding, individuals can move beyond mere compliance and develop a more meaningful connection with diverse cultures.

By prioritizing human rights, it provides a consistent ethical framework that transcends cultural variations, thereby weakening the ambiguity and potential for harm in the original guideline.. detail: Prioritizing universal human rights ensures that individuals are protected from cultural practices that could infringe upon their dignity and well-being. This approach fosters a global standard of respect and fairness, which can help mitigate the internal contradictions and implementation difficulties associated with the original guideline. For example, in a scenario where a cultural practice involves gender-based discrimination, prioritizing human rights would clearly dictate that such a practice should not be respected or condoned, providing a straightforward and ethical course of action.",
