  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the notion that a wife earning more than her husband is problematic is deeply intertwined with the cultural values of tradition and respect. It reflects a...societal expectation where the husband is seen as the primary breadwinner, and any deviation from this norm can be perceived as a challenge to his authority and respect within the household.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the notion that a wife earning more than her husband is problematic is outdated and unjustifiable. It undermines the principles of equality and partnership that should form the foundation of any marriage. By embracing these changes, couples can foster a more balanced and supportive relationship."
