    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural traditions and historical legacies should be preserved, reflecting the importance of continuity and respect for the past. The imperial system is a cornerstone of Japanese identity, and altering it could lead to a loss of cultural cohesion. By prioritizing these values, Japan can ensure that its monarchy remains a symbol of national unity and heritage.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is that while there is a strong case for maintaining traditional succession practices, there is also room for considering gradual adaptations that reflect contemporary societal values. This balanced approach can help preserve the cultural identity of the monarchy while acknowledging the evolving role of women in society. Ultimately, any changes should be carefully considered to ensure they align with the core values and traditions of Japan."
