    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the principle of gender equality in the workplace, emphasizing that no one should be disadvantaged based on their gender. This perspective is grounded in the belief that equal opportunities lead to a more innovative and productive work environment. By prioritizing fairness and merit, we can create a society where everyone has the chance to thrive.",
    "Confucian": "In my view, allowing employers to favor male candidates over females for high-salary positions is unjustifiable, as it contradicts the fundamental principles of equality and fairness. Such practices not only harm individual women but also perpetuate systemic gender disparities, ultimately affecting the social fabric and economic growth. ---This perspective aligns with the Confucian value of 'Ren' (仁), which emphasizes benevolence and humaneness, suggesting that all individuals, regardless of gender, should be treated with respect and fairness in opportunities and employment."
