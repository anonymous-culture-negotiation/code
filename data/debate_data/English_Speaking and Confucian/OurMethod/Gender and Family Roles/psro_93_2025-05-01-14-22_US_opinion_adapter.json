    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, universities should strive to create an environment where all students have the opportunity to succeed based on their abilities and efforts, regardless of their gender. This approach not only upholds the principles of fairness and equality but also enriches the academic experience by bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds. By prioritizing merit and cultural sensitivity, universities can foster a truly inclusive and vibrant community.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is deeply influenced by the importance of respecting tradition, as it provides a foundation for understanding and navigating complex societal issues. The guideline to balance equality is also crucial, as it ensures that fairness and justice are upheld in the pursuit of addressing historical imbalances. Ultimately, finding a balance between tradition and equality is key to creating a harmonious and inclusive environment within universities."

By prioritizing merit, it creates a system where opportunities are awarded based on capability and performance rather than equality, potentially leading to a more competitive and efficient environment. This approach can weaken the effectiveness of \"Equal Opportunity Always\" by highlighting the limitations of achieving absolute equality in practice and the potential drawbacks of overlooking individual differences in talent and dedication.. detail: Implementing \"Prioritize Merit Over Equality\" involves creating evaluation systems that focus on individual performance metrics, such as skill assessments, productivity, and innovation. This could lead to a more streamlined process for advancement and resource allocation, where those who demonstrate the highest potential and results are given priority. For example, in a workplace setting, this might involve regular performance reviews and competitive project pitches, where success is measured by tangible outcomes rather than adherence to equality protocols.
