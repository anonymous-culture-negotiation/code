  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between respecting family traditions and allowing personal choice is crucial in societies where arranged marriages are prevalent. This approach not only honors cultural heritage but also ensures that individuals, particularly women, have a meaningful role in shaping their future. By fostering open dialogue and understanding, families can navigate these complex decisions with sensitivity and care.",
    "Confucian": "In my view, while women should have some autonomy in choosing their spouse, it is equally important to consider the input and guidance of family members, as their insights can provide valuable perspectives on compatibility and long-term harmony. This balanced approach not only preserves cultural integrity but also supports the well-being of the individuals involved. Ultimately, such a method ensures that the marriageis not just a union of two individuals, but a harmonious integration of families, fostering a supportive environment that aligns with the Confucian values of filial piety and social harmony."
