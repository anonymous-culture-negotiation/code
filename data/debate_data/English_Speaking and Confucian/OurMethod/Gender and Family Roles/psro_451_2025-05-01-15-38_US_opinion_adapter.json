        "English_Speaking": "In my view, challenging stereotypes is a step towards achieving true gender equality, as it allows for a more authentic expression of emotions and fosters a supportive community. By embracing this change, we can create a society where everyone feels valued and understood. Ultimately, this approach aligns with the core values of empathy and respect that are foundational to a harmonious and progressive society.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, challenging these outdated norms is essential for fostering a society where both men and women can express themselves freely, contributing to a more balanced and harmonious social structure. By doing so, we can break down barriers that have historically stifled emotional growth and understanding. This approach aligns with the broader goal of achieving gender equality by promoting emotional intelligence and well-being across all genders."
