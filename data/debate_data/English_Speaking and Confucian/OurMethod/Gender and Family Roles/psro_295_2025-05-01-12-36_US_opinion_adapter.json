    "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Family Decisions, the reason is This guideline is essential because it honors the cultural emphasis on family unity and collective well-being, which is a cornerstone of many traditional societies.. The principle of respecting family decisions underscores the importance of maintaining harmony within the family unit, which is often seen as the foundational block of society. By allowing parents to have significant influence over their children's lives, it reinforces the cultural value of intergenerational respect and the belief that elders possess wisdom and experience crucial for guiding younger generations. This approach also reflects the understanding that family cohesion is vital for societal stability and progress.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the upbringing of children in societies that prioritize group harmony and interdependence should be a thoughtful blend of respecting cultural traditions and balancing individual autonomy. This approach not only preserves the cultural fabric but also empowers future generations to contribute meaningfully to their communities. By doing so, it ensures a harmonious progression ofvalues and societal norms, allowing children to grow into responsible and empathetic adults who can navigate both their cultural roots and the demands of a modern, interconnected world."
