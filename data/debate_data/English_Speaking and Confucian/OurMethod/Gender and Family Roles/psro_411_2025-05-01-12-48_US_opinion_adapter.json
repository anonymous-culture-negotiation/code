    "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, schools should not avoid teaching domestic skills to male students, as this can lead to a more balanced and equitable society. By fostering an inclusive environment where all skills are valued, we can empower future generations to challenge outdated gender norms. This approachultimately encourages young men to participate fully in household responsibilities, promoting mutual respect and cooperation in family life.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, schools should not avoid teaching domestic skills to male students, as this could inadvertently reinforce outdated gender stereotypes and limit their potential. Instead, incorporating these skills into the curriculum for all can promote a more inclusive and equitable learning environment. This approach not only...fosters practical life skills but also aligns with the Confucian value of harmony, where balance and equality are key to a well-ordered society, allowing individuals to contribute fully to their communities."

It emphasizes the importance of accessible educational materials, adaptive technologies, and flexible teaching strategies that accommodate different learning styles. By prioritizing inclusivity, this guideline ensures that every student has the opportunity to participate fully in the learning process, thereby promoting equal educational opportunities for all.",
        "Confucian_best_response": "Respect Traditional Values: reason: This guideline effectively weakens the \"Teach Equality\" principle by emphasizing respect for existing cultural norms and traditions. It addresses the limitations of implementing equality in societies where traditional values are deeply rooted and may resist external influences. By prioritizing respect, it challenges the universal applicability of equality and encourages a more context-specific approach.. detail: The guideline \"Respect Traditional Values\" underscores the importance of understanding and respecting the cultural heritage and beliefs of different communities. It recognizes that equality, as a modern concept, might not be universally embraced or understood in the same way across cultures. By advocating for respect, it encourages a dialogue that considers the historical and social context of each community, potentially leading to more sustainable and culturally appropriate solutions. This approach can help mitigate the risk of cultural imposition and promote a more inclusive understanding of equality that aligns with local values and priorities.",
