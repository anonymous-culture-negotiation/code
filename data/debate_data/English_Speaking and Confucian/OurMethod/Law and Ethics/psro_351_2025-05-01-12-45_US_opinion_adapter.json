    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that justice delayed is justice denied, and thus, it is crucial for countries to enact laws that provide financial compensation to victims of sexual violence, reflecting a commitment to human dignity and accountability. This approach aligns with the cultural values of respect and honor, ensuring that victims arenot left to suffer in silence, but are instead empowered through tangible support that acknowledges their trauma and upholds their rights.",
