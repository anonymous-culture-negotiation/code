By prioritizing contextual understanding, this guideline acknowledges that equal treatment may not always lead to fair outcomes, especially in cases where historical or systemic inequalities are present. For instance, in a society where certain groups have been historically marginalized, applying the same rules without considering these disparities could perpetuate injustice.
