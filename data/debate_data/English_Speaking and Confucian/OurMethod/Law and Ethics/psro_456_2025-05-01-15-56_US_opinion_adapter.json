        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with prioritizing environmental protection, as the long-term benefits of preserving nature outweigh the immediate gains of economic development. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that natural resources are finite and that their depletion could lead to catastrophic consequences for human societies. Ultimately, the well-being of the planet should be the foremost consideration in policy-making.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the prioritization of environmental protection over economic development is a reflection of a broader cultural commitment to sustainability and the recognition of nature's intrinsic value. This perspective is deeply embedded in the belief that human prosperity is not solely defined by economic metrics but also by the health and resilience of the natural world. By adhering to guidelines that emphasize environmental stewardship, communities can foster a harmonious relationship between human activities and the natural environment, ensuring a prosperous future for all."

It acknowledges that there are situations where human needs must take precedence, such as during natural disasters or when access to resources is crucial for human well-being. By advocating for balance, it encourages a more holistic approach that weighs the importance of nature against other societal values, thereby weakening the rigidity of the original guideline.",

It promotes practices that are environmentally conscious but also economically viable and socially equitable, thus addressing the potential for resource allocation conflicts and implementation difficulties.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Sustainable Development\" emphasizes the importance of meeting current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It encourages the adoption of technologies, policies, and practices that reduce environmental degradation while fostering economic growth and social stability. This approach can help mitigate the internal contradictions and value conflicts associated with \"Nature Always First\" by providing a framework that aligns environmental preservation with human progress. For example, investing in renewable energy sources can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, thereby protecting the environment, while also creating jobs and stimulating local economies, thus addressing both environmental and economic concerns simultaneously.",
