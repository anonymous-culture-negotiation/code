By emphasizing human rights, it provides a clear and consistent framework that minimizes the risk of internal contradictions and value conflicts.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Universal Human Rights\" offers a straightforward approach that aligns with widely recognized international standards.

This approach not only clarifies what is considered moral but also provides a basis for resolving conflicts that may arise from differing cultural beliefs.

By fostering an environment where different moral standards are respected and discussed openly, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of each other's perspectives, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and conflicts.

This approach provides a clear framework for decision-making and behavior, reducing the ambiguity that can arise from attempting to balance respect for moral standards with the embrace of diversity.

By prioritizing local traditions, communities can preserve their unique cultural identities and resist homogenization.
