    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the legal allowance of physical discipline by parents should be approached with caution, balancing cultural respect with child safety. This involves understanding and respecting diverse cultural traditions while implementing measures to prevent abuse. Ultimately, the goal is to create a harmonious and inclusive society where cultural diversity is celebrated and children are protected.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural traditions should be respected, but not at the expense of child welfare. The guidelines suggest a balanced approach where cultural practices are honored while ensuring children's safety and well-being. Ultimately, any legal stance should reflect a thoughtful consideration of these dual priorities."
