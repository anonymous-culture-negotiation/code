    "topic": "Should severe corporal punishments like flogging and limb amputation be legally allowed as criminal penalties under Islamic religious law (Sharia)?",
    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the integration of Sharia Law into legal frameworks, particularly regarding corporal punishments, as it reflects a deep commitment to preserving Islamic values and traditions. This approach ensures that justice is administered in a manner consistent with religious beliefs, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among the community.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that corporal punishments such as flogging and limb amputation are inhumane and counterproductive. They not only cause irreparable physical damage but also fail to address the root causes of criminal behavior, thus undermining the potential for genuine reform. Ultimately, such practices are incompatible with the values of mercy and justice that underpin my cultural identity."

By allowing for necessary restraint, it provides a clear exception to the \"No physical harm\" rule, thereby addressing one of its significant weaknesses. This approach recognizes that physical intervention can sometimes be a lesser evil and provides a framework for evaluating when such actions are appropriate, thus weakening the strict interpretation of the other party's guidelines.",

By prioritizing human rights, it helps to safeguard against discrimination and marginalization, which can be concerns when Sharia Law is applied in a way that does not account for diverse perspectives.
