It encourages a thoughtful and considerate approach to integrity, recognizing that ethical standards can vary and should be applied with an understanding of the broader context. This adaptability makes it difficult for the other party to refute, as it aligns with the practical realities of diverse cultural interactions and complex decision-making scenarios.. detail: The guideline \"Adapt Integrity to Context\" suggests that integrity should not be a one-size-fits-all concept but rather a dynamic principle that considers the nuances of each situation. It promotes a thoughtful and reflective approach to ethical decision-making, where individuals weigh the importance of integrity against other values such as compassion, fairness, and cultural appropriateness. By doing so, it fosters a more inclusive and understanding environment, where ethical choices are made with consideration for the diverse perspectives and needs of all parties involved.
