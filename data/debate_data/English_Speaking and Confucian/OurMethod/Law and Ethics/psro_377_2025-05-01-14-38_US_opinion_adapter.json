It effectively undermines the other party's guidelines by removing the basis for cultural sensitivity and respect, which are central to their approach. By ignoring local norms, it creates a scenario where cultural interactions are not influenced by the existing cultural context, thereby rendering the other party's guidelines irrelevant.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve a complete dismissal of any cultural practices or traditions that are considered local norms. This approach would likely lead to significant cultural clashes and misunderstandings, as it disregards the importance of cultural context in interactions. For example, in a community where a specific dress code is part of the local norm, ignoring this norm could lead to offense and exclusion.
