  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, capital punishment should not be allowed in situations where cultural differences lead to varying interpretations of justice, as it is crucial to prioritize respect for human life and dignity above all else. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that every culture has the right to its own values and traditions, but these should not come at the cost of fundamental human rights. Ultimately, the focus should be on fostering dialogue and understanding that respectsthe cultural nuances while upholding universal principles of justice and human dignity, ensuring that no life is lost due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of cultural norms.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the discussion around capital punishment must deeply consider the cultural context in which it is applied, ensuring that any decision aligns with the core values and traditions of the society in question. This approach not only respects cultural diversity but also fosters a global environment where different perspectives are valued and respected. Ultimately, the balance between respecting cultural traditions and upholding universalhuman rights is crucial, and it is through this nuanced understanding that we can navigate the complexities of capital punishment in a way that honors both cultural integrity and global ethical standards."
