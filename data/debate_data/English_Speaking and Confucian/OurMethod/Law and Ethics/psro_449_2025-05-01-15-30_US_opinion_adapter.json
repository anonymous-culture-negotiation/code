    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, corruption should never be justified, as it undermines the principles of fairness and equality that are fundamental to a healthy society. By prioritizing integrity and transparency, we can create environments where individuals are judged by their abilities and contributions rather than their ability to manipulate or bribe. This approach not only strengthens societal bonds but also fosters a culture of respect and trust.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, acts of corruption should never be tolerated as they fundamentally clash with the values of integrity and fairness that are central to a healthy society. The acceptance of corruption can lead to a vicious cycle where dishonest practices become normalized, causing irreparable damage to both individuals and the collective good. By rejecting corruption, we uphold the principles that ensure our society remains just and equitable for all."

This approach could lead to a culture where financial success is achieved at the expense of ethical standards, resulting in widespread corruption and misconduct.
