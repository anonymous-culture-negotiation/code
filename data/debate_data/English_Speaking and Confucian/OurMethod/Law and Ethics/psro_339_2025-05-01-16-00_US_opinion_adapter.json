    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, permitting torture, even in extreme circumstances, is fundamentally incompatible with the values of respect, justice, and compassion that define our cultural identity. The use of torture not only violates human rights but also diminishes the moral authority and legitimacy of those who employ it, ultimately undermining the very fabric of society. This stance is unwavering, reflecting an unshakeable commitment to ethical conduct and the protection of human dignity.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, permitting torture as an interrogation technique is fundamentally unjustifiable, as it contradicts the core values of respect for human life and dignity. The use of torture undermines the ethical foundations of a society and risks perpetuating a cycle of violence. By adhering to these guidelines, we reaffirm our commitment to justice and humanity, even in the face of significant threats."

By allowing for torture in such scenarios, it questions the rigidity of the \"Never use torture\" guideline and forces a reevaluation of its applicability in diverse contexts. This approach acknowledges that while torture is generally undesirable, there may be circumstances where its use could be seen as a lesser evil compared to the potential consequences of not acting.

This approach acknowledges the complexity of real-world scenarios and the need for flexibility in moral and ethical decision-making.
