        "Confucian": "we insist Respect Life Always, the reason is This guideline is rooted in the belief that life is inherently valuable and should be preserved, which is a fundamental tenet in many cultures that emphasize the sanctity of human existence.. The principle of respecting life always is deeply intertwined with cultural and religious values that prioritize the preservation of life under all circumstances. This perspective is often supported by the idea that life has inherent dignity, and ending it, even with assistance, undermines this dignity. It also reflects concerns about the potential for abuse and the slippery slope of allowing euthanasia, which could lead to the devaluation of life in society."
