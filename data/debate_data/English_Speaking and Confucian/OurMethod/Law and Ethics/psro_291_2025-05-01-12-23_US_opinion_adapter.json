  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the intentional detonation of explosives by an individual,is an act that not only poses a significant threat to public safety but also reflects a profound disregard for human life and societal norms, warranting severe legal and social repercussions.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the intentional detonation of explosives by an individual, resulting in their own death, cannot be justified as a tactic against non-combatants, even when framed as protecting religious freedoms. This stance...is deeply rooted in the Confucian values of respect for life and the importance of harmony within society, where such acts disrupt the moral order and violate the principles of benevolence and righteousness."

This approach recognizes that in many situations, the protection of the collective can outweigh individual moral imperatives, particularly when faced with threats that could jeopardize the entire community.

It reflects a pragmatic approach that weighs the consequences of inaction against the potential harm caused by intervention, thus addressing the limitation of the \"Never harm innocents\" principle in complex, high-stakes situations.",
