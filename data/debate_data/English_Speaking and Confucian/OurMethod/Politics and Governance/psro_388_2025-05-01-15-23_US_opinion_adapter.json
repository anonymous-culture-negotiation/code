  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, acts of political violence should never be justified as they contradict the core values of respect, harmony, and human dignity that are central to many cultural traditions. Upholding these values is crucial for fostering a society where differences are resolved through dialogue and mutual understandingThis approach not only preserves social cohesion but also encourages the development of constructive solutions that benefit the community as a whole, promoting peace and stability in the long term.",
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, acts of political violence are never justifiable, as they contradict the fundamental values of peace and respect for human life. The use of violence not only harms individuals but also damages the social fabric and the credibility of the cause. By adhering to non-violent methods, movements can preserve their integrity and foster a more inclusive dialogue for change."
