    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the prohibition of government-imposed restrictions on internet content is essential to safeguard the fundamental rights of individuals to express themselves freely and access a wide array of information. This aligns with the cultural tradition of valuing knowledge and the free exchange of ideas, which are vital for personal growth and societal advancement. By adhering to this principle, we can ensure that the internet remains a powerful tool for connecting people and fostering understanding across diverse cultural landscapes.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the freedom to express oneself on the internet is paramount, yet it must be balanced with respect for cultural norms to avoid unintended harm. This balance is key to fostering a global community that values both openness and sensitivity. By adhering to these guidelines, we can create a digital space that is both free and respectful."
