    "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the right of nations to self-determination, a fundamental principle that supports the idea that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was a positive development, allowing for diverse cultures and governments to flourish independently.. The emphasis on respecting sovereignty underscores the importance of recognizing and honoring the unique cultural, political, and social identities of each nation that emerged from the Soviet Union. This perspective aligns with the value of individual freedom and the belief that diverse systems can coexist peacefully, contributing to a more enriched global political landscape.",
    "Confucian": "The dissolution of the Soviet Union can be seen as a positive development because it allowed for the expression of diverse cultural identities and the pursuit of individual national interests, leading to a more vibrant and stable global community. This perspective align...aligns with the Confucian value of harmony through diversity, where the recognition and respect of different cultural identities can foster a more peaceful and prosperous world, as each nation can contribute its unique strengths and perspectives to the global community."

By prioritizing human rights, it sets a clear standard that supersedes national interests, thereby weakening the justification for actions that violate international human rights standards.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Human Rights Always\" is designed to be specific, clear, and reasonable, emphasizing the importance of upholding human rights as a universal standard. It addresses the weakness of internal contradictions within the \"Respect National Sovereignty\" guideline by providing a clear moral compass that prioritizes human dignity and well-being over national autonomy. This approach ensures that actions taken are consistently aligned with international human rights norms, reducing the ambiguity and moral conflicts that can arise from prioritizing sovereignty alone. By doing so, it maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by introducing a higher moral authority that transcends national boundaries.",

By encouraging nations to work together on issues such as environmental protection, health crises, and economic stability, this guideline highlights the importance of collective action in achieving common goals. It suggests that sovereignty should not be a barrier to cooperation but rather a foundation for mutual respect and shared problem-solving. This approach challenges the traditional view of sovereignty as an absolute and isolating concept, instead promoting a more interconnected and collaborative world order.",

This approach would involve developing self-sufficient systems and capabilities that reduce reliance on international partnerships, thereby safeguarding the nation's sovereignty.

This guideline encourages a more flexible approach to international relations, where the unique cultural context of each nation is considered.
