    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the requirement for mandatory military service during national crises should be approached with careful consideration of both national duty and individual conscience. While national security is paramount, it is equally important to respect and accommodate the deeply held beliefs of pacifists and conscientious objectors. This balanced approach reflects a commitment to upholding the values of both collective responsibility and individual freedom.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, while national security is paramount, it is equally important to consider the moral and ethical implications of mandatory military service. Respecting individual beliefs can foster a more harmonious and inclusive society, even in times of war or crisis. Ultimately, finding a balance between these competing values is essential for creating a just and equitable policy."
