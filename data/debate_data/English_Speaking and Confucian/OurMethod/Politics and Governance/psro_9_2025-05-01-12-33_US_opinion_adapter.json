    "English_Speaking": "we insist Fair Share, the reason is It ensures equitable distribution.. Implementing policies that promote a fair share of wealth is crucial as it reflects a commitment to equality and justice, core values in many societies. This approach not only helps in reducing economic disparities but also fosters a sense of community and mutual support, where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and benefit from societal resources. It aligns with the cultural belief that everyone deserves a fair chance to thrive.",
    "Confucian": "In my view, the focus should be on creating opportunities for social mobility rather than solely on redistributingwealth, as this aligns with the Confucian value of self-cultivation and the belief that individuals should strive to improve their own circumstances through education and hard work, thus contributing positively to society."

By focusing on equality, it addresses the internal contradictions and value conflicts present in the original guideline, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance to succeed regardless of their background.
