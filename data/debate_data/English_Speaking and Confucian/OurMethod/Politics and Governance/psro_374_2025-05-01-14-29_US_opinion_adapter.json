        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between respecting laws and challenging them constructively is crucial in a democratic society. This approach allows individuals to uphold their values while contributing to the democratic process, ensuring that their voices are heard and considered.

This approach recognizes that laws are not always just or equitable and that there is a moral obligation to act against them when they cause harm.

By ignoring laws selectively, individuals can challenge unjust laws without necessarily resorting to widespread disobedience, which can help maintain social order while still advocating for justice.

This collective approach can mobilize broader support and resources, making it more feasible to challenge unjust laws effectively. It also aligns with historical examples of successful social movements that have achieved significant legal and ethical changes through unified action, thereby weakening the constraints of the original guidelines.",
