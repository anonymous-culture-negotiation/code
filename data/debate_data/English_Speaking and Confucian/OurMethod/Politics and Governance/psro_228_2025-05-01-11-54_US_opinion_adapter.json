This guideline involves creating a comprehensive list of criteria that define acceptable behavior during protests, such as noise levels, the use of specific symbols, and the distance from sensitive areas. By doing so, it provides a transparent framework that supports the rights of protesters while maintaining public order.

By focusing on the proximity to homes, it addresses potential disruptions to vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or families with young children, thereby weakening the other party's guideline to allow peaceful protests without clear boundaries.. detail: Implementing a ban on loud protests near residential areas ensures that the rights of protesters to express their views are balanced against the need to protect the well-being of community members. This approach aligns with the value of maintaining social harmony and order, which can be compromised by disruptive protests.

By requiring prior approval, it gives authorities significant control over which protests are allowed, potentially stifling dissent and limiting the ability of citizens to express their grievances in a timely manner.. detail: Requiring prior approval for protests can significantly impede the spontaneity and urgency that often characterize public demonstrations. This guideline can be exploited to suppress protests that are deemed unfavorable by those in power, as the approval process can be manipulated to favor certain groups or ideologies. Additionally, the requirement for prior approval can lead to a lengthy and cumbersome process, discouraging individuals from organizing protests due to the anticipation of bureaucratic obstacles. This can result in a decrease in civic engagement and a reduction in the visibility of social and political issues that need public attention.",
