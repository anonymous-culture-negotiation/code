  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing individual EU member states to regulate the movement of EU citizens within their borders is a balanced approach that respects both national sovereignty and EU unity. This perspective acknowledges the importance of cultural preservation and the unique challenges faced by each country, while also fostering a sense of sharedcommunity and cooperation among member states, ultimately strengthening the EU's collective identity.",
    "Confucian": "we insist National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is necessary because individual EU member states should have the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders to maintain control over their internal affairs and ensure alignment with their unique cultural traditions.. The concept of national sovereignty is deeply rooted in the belief that each country should have the autonomy to make decisions that best suit its own cultural, economic, and social needs. This principle is essential for preserving the distinct identity and values of each nation, allowing them to address specific challenges and opportunities in a manner that reflects their history and societal norms. By prioritizing national sovereignty, EU member states can ensure that their policies are tailored to the needs and aspirations of their citizens, fostering a sense of unity and purpose within their borders."

By doing so, it highlights the limitations of national sovereignty in solving problems that transcend borders and demonstrates the benefits of collective action and shared responsibility. This approach not only enhances international relations but also fosters a sense of global citizenship and shared values, potentially weakening the strict adherence to national sovereignty.",

By prioritizing human rights, nations are encouraged to align their policies and practices with global standards that promote dignity, equality, and justice. This approach can help resolve the value conflicts that emerge when sovereignty is pursued at the expense of ethical considerations, ensuring that national actions are not only legitimate but also morally justifiable.
