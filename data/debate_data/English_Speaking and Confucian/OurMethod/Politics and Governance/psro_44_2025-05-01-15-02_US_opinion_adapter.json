    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that European Union member countries should have the right to hold nationwide votes on withdrawing from the EU, as this aligns with the principle of respecting national sovereignty and allowing citizens to have a direct say in matters that affect their country's future. This approach not only fosters democratic participation but also ensures that the decisions made are reflective of the collective will of the people. By prioritizing national sovereignty, we uphold the values of autonomy and self-governance that are integral to the identity of European nations.",
        "Confucian": "we insist Preserve National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it allows EU member countries to maintain control over their own destiny and make decisions that align with their unique cultural and historical contexts.. Preserving national sovereignty is crucial for EU member countries as it ensures that they can uphold their distinct cultural traditions and values, which may not always align with the broader EU policies. This guideline respects the diversity within the EU and acknowledges that each member state has its own set of priorities and concerns that should be addressed through self-governance. By allowing nationwide votes on EU membership, countries can express their commitment to their own identity and make decisions that reflect the will of their people."
