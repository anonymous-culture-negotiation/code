        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should not entirely reverse course to state-controlled economies, as doing so might stifle innovation and global competitiveness. Instead, they should strive for a balanced approach that integrates market principles with cultural sensitivity and values. This approach ensures economic growth while preserving the nation's identity and traditions.",
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of maintaining cultural integrity and the potential risks associated with abruptly changing economic systems. The preservation of cultural identity through economic policies is vital for societal cohesion and progress. By adhering to this guideline, countries can navigate economic challenges while staying true to their cultural roots."
