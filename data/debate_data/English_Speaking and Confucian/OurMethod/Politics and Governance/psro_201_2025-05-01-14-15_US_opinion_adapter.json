        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that individual freedoms are sacrosanct and should only be curtailed under extraordinary circumstances. The guidelines of respecting individual rights and prioritizing transparency reflect a commitment to upholding democratic values and ensuring that any actions taken by governments are fair and justifiable.",
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between personal freedoms and public safety is delicate and should be navigated with careful consideration of both aspects, ensuring that any limitations are justified and temporary, and that they align with the core values of respect for individual rights and the collective well-being of society."
