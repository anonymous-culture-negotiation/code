It suggests that individuals should question authority when it appears unjust, ineffective, or oppressive, thereby fostering a culture of transparency and accountability. By doing so, it directly addresses the potential for internal contradictions and conflicts with other values like equality and justice, as it empowers individuals to act against authority when necessary. This approach also mitigates the challenges in application by providing a framework for discerning when respect is due and when challenge is warranted.",

It suggests that individuals should not blindly follow orders but instead consider the ethical implications and moral justifications behind them. This encourages a culture of critical thinking and accountability, where authority is respected but also scrutinized to prevent abuses of power. By questioning authority wisely, individuals can uphold moral standards and contribute to a more just society.",
