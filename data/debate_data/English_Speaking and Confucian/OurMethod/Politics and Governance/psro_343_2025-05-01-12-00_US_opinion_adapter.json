By ignoring local voices, it undermines the community's ability to influence decisions regarding cultural heritage, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that rely heavily on community involvement.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve systematically disregarding any input or feedback from local communities when making decisions about cultural preservation. This could be achieved through centralized decision-making processes that exclude community representatives or by establishing policies that override local preferences. For instance, if a local community opposes the demolition of a historical building to make way for new development, this guideline would support proceeding with the demolition without considering the community's concerns.

By doing so, it clarifies what aspects of cultural heritage are truly essential, thereby reducing confusion and facilitating a more consistent approach to cultural preservation. This specificity also helps in allocating resources more efficiently, as efforts are concentrated on vital cultural elements rather than attempting to preserve everything, which can be overwhelming and impractical.. detail: The guideline \"Preserve Core Traditions Only\" offers a straightforward approach to cultural heritage management by prioritizing the most fundamental and enduring aspects of a culture. This strategy acknowledges that not all traditions are equally important or relevant in contemporary society, allowing for a more selective and resource-efficient preservation effort. For example, a community might focus on preserving its unique linguistic heritage, traditional music, or specific religious rituals that are central to its identity, while being more open to evolution in other areas. This approach not only helps in maintaining cultural continuity but also fosters a sense of shared purpose and unity among community members, as they collectively prioritize and protect their most cherished cultural practices.",
