    "English_Speaking": "In my view, democratic nations should indeed apply different standards when managing anti-government demonstrations, prioritizing respect for freedom and the rule of law. This approach not only aligns with the core values of democracy but also distinguishes it from non-democratic systems that often prioritize control over citizenrights, thereby fostering a culture of transparency and accountability that strengthens public trust and civic engagement.",

By doing so, it addresses the internal contradictions and potential value conflicts inherent in \"Respect Freedom,\" as it promotes a balance between individual rights and communal responsibilities.
