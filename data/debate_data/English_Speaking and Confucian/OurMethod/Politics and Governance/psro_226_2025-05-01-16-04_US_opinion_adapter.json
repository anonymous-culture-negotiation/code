By doing so, it addresses the internal contradiction of respecting cultural heritage that may conflict with universal values, providing a clear direction that prioritizes human dignity and rights above cultural norms.",

This approach might result in a gradual erosion of traditional values and customs, as individuals become more accustomed to shared, homogenized cultural expressions. The emphasis on exchange rather than preservation could make it difficult for communities to maintain their unique cultural heritage, thus weakening the original guideline's intent.",

It forces the other party to consider and rectify any imbalances in cultural representation, which can be a significant point of contention if not addressed proactively.. detail: Prioritizing cultural equity involves actively ensuring that all cultures have an equal platform to share their traditions, values, and contributions.

This approach can lead to the suppression of individual rights, particularly in contexts where traditional practices are at odds with modern human rights standards. For instance, in a society where traditional gender roles are deeply ingrained, this guideline might justify limiting women's participation in public life or decision-making processes, directly conflicting with human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination.",
