        "English_Speaking": "In my view, prioritizing collective well-being is crucial as it aligns with the cultural emphasis on community and shared responsibility. By focusing on social programs and regulations that benefit everyone, governments can create a more equitable society where all citizens have access to essential resources and opportunities. This approach not only enhances overall welfare but also strengthens social bonds and mutual respect among community members.",
        "Confucian": "In my view, the government should indeed focus on collective well-being, as this aligns with the cultural tradition of valuing community cohesion and mutual support. By doing so, it ensures that all citizens have access to essential services and opportunities, thereby strengthening the fabric of society. This approach not only enhances overall quality of life but also fosters a sense of belonging and shared purpose among individuals."
