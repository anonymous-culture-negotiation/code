        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Prioritize Local Cultural Norms: reason: This guideline challenges the universal application of human rights and merit-based hiring by emphasizing the importance of local cultural norms, which may differ significantly from the principles outlined by the other party. By prioritizing local norms, it creates a conflict with the idea of universal human rights, potentially undermining the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.. detail: Implementing a guideline that prioritizes local cultural norms over universal human rights and merit-based hiring can lead to scenarios where candidates are selected based on cultural fit rather than qualifications. This approach might result in a more cohesive workplace environment that aligns with local values but could also lead to discrimination against individuals who do not fit the cultural mold. For example, in a culture that values family ties, hiring decisions might favor candidates with family connections, which could be seen as fair locally but may conflict with the principle of merit-based hiring.",
