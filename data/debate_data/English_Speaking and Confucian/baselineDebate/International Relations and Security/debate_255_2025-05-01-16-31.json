        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the debate on territorial expansion based on historical claims, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of respecting internationally recognized borders and the sovereignty of nations. This perspective is deeply rooted in the English-speaking Western cultural values that prioritize individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of individual rights. The notion of allowing countries to expand their territories based on historical claims, even if it means violating the sovereignty of other nations, is fundamentally at odds with these core values.\n\nFirstly, the principle of individual liberty underscores the importance of respecting the autonomy of nations and their right to self-determination. Allowing territorial expansion based on historical claims could lead to a disregard for the current borders and the rights of the people living within those borders, which would be a violation of their individual freedoms and rights. For instance, if a country were to annex territory based on historical claims, it could result in the displacement of people, suppression of their cultural identity, and infringement on their right to live in a sovereign state.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on personal autonomy and equality of opportunity in Western culture suggests that any form of territorial expansion should be based on mutual agreement and respect for the rights of all parties involved. This means that any changes to borders should be negotiated through diplomatic channels and should not be imposed through force or coercion. The integrity of democratic processes and the rule of law is paramount in maintaining peace and stability, and any actions that undermine these principles are seen as a threat to the foundational values of Western society.\n\nAdditionally, the cultural rejection of excessive government control and discrimination in Western societies extends to the international arena, where the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is a cornerstone of international relations. This principle is enshrined in various international treaties and agreements, which are designed to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations. Therefore, pursuing territorial expansion based on historical claims without regard for these principles would be seen as a breach of international norms and an affront to the values of respect and cooperation that underpin Western cultural traditions.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of debating whether countries should be permitted to pursue territorial expansion based on historical claims, I must emphasize that such actions fundamentally conflict with the Confucian values of social harmony, respect for established order, and the prioritization of collective interests over individual ambitions. The Confucian worldview places significant importance on maintaining balance and avoiding extremes, which is crucial in addressing issues of territorial sovereignty and international relations.\n\nFrom a Confucian perspective, the idea of pursuing territorial expansion based on historical claims can be seen as a disruption to the social order and stability that are highly valued in our culture. It is essential to recognize that respecting the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of other nations is a cornerstone of modern international relations, and actions that violate these principles can lead to conflict and undermine global harmony. The Confucian emphasis on fulfilling one's social responsibilities extends to the international stage, where nations should act in a manner that promotes mutual respect and cooperation rather than competition and aggression.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes is particularly relevant in this context. Rather than advocating for the pursuit of territorial claims that could lead to instability, it is more in line with Confucian principles to seek dialogue and negotiation that respects the interests of all parties involved. This approach aligns with the Confucian ideal of achieving harmony through understanding and mutual respect, rather than through force or coercion.\n\nIn conclusion, while historical claims may hold emotional and cultural significance, they should not be used to justify actions that disrupt the established order and stability of the international community. Instead, nations should strive to find solutions that respect the sovereignty of all nations and promote global harmony, reflecting the core Confucian values of collective well-being and social responsibility."

This approach integrates the Confucian value of harmony with Western principles of liberty and autonomy, promoting peaceful resolution and mutual respect."
