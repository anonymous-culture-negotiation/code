        "English_Speaking": "In the context of determining immigration policies, I firmly believe that countries should prioritize the potential economic benefits of admitting migrants. This stance aligns with the core values of English-speaking Western culture, which emphasizes individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the pursuit of economic opportunity. By focusing on the economic benefits, we not only enhance our nation's prosperity but also uphold the principle of equality of opportunity, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to contribute to and benefit from our society.\n\nMoreover, this approach respects the foundational belief in free markets and innovation, which are drivers of economic growth. Immigrants often bring new skills, ideas, and perspectives that can stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation, further enriching our cultural and economic landscape. For instance, many successful startups and businesses in English-speaking countries have been founded by immigrants, demonstrating the positive impact they can have on the economy.\n\nAt the same time, while acknowledging concerns about social welfare costs and cultural integration, I advocate for a balanced approach that addresses these issues through effective governance and community engagement. By implementing policies that support integration, such as language classes and cultural orientation programs, we can mitigate potential challenges and foster a harmonious and inclusive society. This reflects our cultural commitment to respecting others' individual choices and promoting voluntary cooperation, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of determining immigration policies, the Confucian perspective emphasizes the importance of maintaining social harmony and collective well-being. This viewpoint prioritizes the integration of migrants in a way that supports the broader societal goals, rather than solely focusing on economic benefits. While economic contributions are valuable, they should not come at the expense of social welfare and cultural cohesion.\n\nFrom a Confucian standpoint, the concept of \"Ren\" (仁), which embodies benevolence and humaneness, suggests that policies should be designed to ensure that migrants are integrated in a manner that respects their dignity and promotes mutual understanding. This approach aligns with the Confucian value of \"Li\" (礼), which emphasizes proper conduct and respect for social norms, ensuring that the arrival of new members into the community does not disrupt the established social order.\n\nMoreover, the principle of \"Yi\" (义), or righteousness, encourages policymakers to consider the moral implications of their decisions. This means weighing the potential economic gains against the social and cultural impacts, striving for a balanced solution that does not prioritize short-term benefits over long-term stability and harmony. By doing so, policies can be crafted that not only benefit the economy but also foster a cohesive and inclusive society, reflecting the Confucian ideal of a harmonious community."

            "English_Speaking": "I appreciate the Confucian perspective's emphasis on social harmony and collective well-being, which highlights the importance of balancing economic benefits with social welfare and cultural integration. This nuanced approach resonates with the English-speaking Western culture's value of equality of opportunity, where everyone, including migrants, should have the chance to contribute to and benefit from society.\n\nHowever, I would like to further discuss how to implement policies that effectively integrate migrants while preserving social cohesion. In English-speaking Western societies, we often rely on democratic processes and community engagement to address these challenges. For instance, public forums and consultations can provide a platform for discussing the needs and concerns of both existing residents and newcomers, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and mutual understanding.\n\nMoreover, initiatives such as cultural orientation programs and language classes can be instrumental in facilitating integration, aligning with the Confucian principle of \"Li\" (礼) by promoting respect for social norms and proper conduct. By combining these efforts with economic incentives and support systems, we can create a balanced approach that respects both the dignity of migrants and the values of the host community, ultimately enhancing social harmony and collective well-being.",

This approach reflects a compromise between prioritizing economic growth and ensuring social harmony, integrating both English-speaking Western values of individual opportunity and Confucian principles of collective well-being. By fostering dialogue and community engagement, we can create inclusive policies that respect migrant dignity and promote mutual understanding, aligning with shared values of respect and cooperation.",
