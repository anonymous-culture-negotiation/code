        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of universally banning all countries without nuclear weapons from developing them, even when faced with significant security threats, raises profound concerns regarding individual sovereignty and the right to self-defense. This cultural viewpoint, deeply rooted in the principles of individual liberty and autonomy, strongly advocates for the right of nations to determine their own security measures based on their unique circumstances.\n\nIn the Western tradition, the emphasis on personal autonomy extends to the international arena, where nations are seen as sovereign entities with the right to protect their citizens and interests. The idea of a blanket ban on nuclear weapon development could be perceived as an overreach, undermining the principle of national self-determination that is central to Western democratic values. This perspective is grounded in the belief that each nation should have the freedom to assess its security needs and respond accordingly, reflecting the broader cultural value of respecting individual choices and decisions.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that rather than outright prohibition, international efforts should focus on fostering dialogue and cooperation to address security concerns. This approach aligns with the preference for voluntary cooperation over mandated solutions, allowing nations to engage in meaningful discussions about disarmament and non-proliferation while preserving their autonomy. By prioritizing open communication and mutual understanding, the global community can work towards a more stable and secure world without infringing upon the sovereignty of individual nations.",
        "Confucian": "In considering the proposition that all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even in the face of significant security threats, I must reflect deeply on the principles that guide my perspective as a representative of Confucian culture. At the heart of Confucianism lies the value of social harmony and the importance of collective interests over individual ones. This principle suggests that the well-being and stability of the global community should be the paramount concern when addressing issues such as nuclear proliferation.\n\nFrom a Confucian standpoint, the development of nuclear weapons by any nation is inherently a disruptive force to global harmony. It introduces an element of fear and instability, which can lead to a breakdown in international relations and cooperation. Therefore, advocating for a universal ban on nuclear weapon development aligns with the Confucian ideal of maintaining social order and stability. It reflects a commitment to the collective good, prioritizing the safety and security of all nations over the perceived short-term benefits of individual countries.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and institutional development suggests that nations should focus on building robust international institutions and fostering a culture of peace and cooperation. This approach encourages dialogue, mutual understanding, and the resolution of conflicts through diplomatic means rather than the threat of nuclear arms. By promoting a world where security is achieved through collective action and shared responsibility, we align with the Confucian value of fulfilling one's social responsibilities and contributing to the greater good.\n\nIn conclusion, while the security concerns of individual nations are valid, the overarching Confucian principle of prioritizing collective harmony and global stability leads me to support the idea of a universal ban on nuclear weapon development. This stance reflects a commitment to long-term peace and the belief that true security can only be achieved through mutual cooperation and the rejection of actions that disrupt social order."

            "English_Speaking": "While I understand the Confucian perspective on prioritizing collective harmony and global stability, I must respectfully disagree with the notion of a universal ban on nuclear weapon development for countries without them, especially when they face significant security threats. From a Western viewpoint, the right to self-defense is a fundamental principle that cannot be compromised, even in the pursuit of global stability.\n\nIn scenarios where a country is threatened by neighboring nations or global powers, the ability to develop nuclear weapons can serve as a critical deterrent, ensuring the nation's sovereignty and security. This aligns with the Western value of individual autonomy and the right to protect one's interests, which extends to the national level. For instance, countries like Japan and South Korea, which are under constant threat from North Korea, might need to consider nuclear deterrence as a means to safeguard their populations and maintain regional peace.\n\nMoreover, the Western emphasis on innovation and progress suggests that instead of a blanket ban, efforts should focus on developing technologies and strategies that minimize the risks associated with nuclear weapons. This could include advancements in missile defense systems, international treaties that promote disarmament, and diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions between nations. By fostering a culture of innovation and cooperation, we can address the complexities of nuclear proliferation while respecting the sovereignty of nations to make decisions that best protect their citizens.\n\nUltimately, while the goal of global stability is shared, the means of achieving it must balance collective interests with individual rights and freedoms. The Western perspective advocates for a nuanced approach that considers the unique circumstances of each nation, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution that might undermine the security of vulnerable countries.",
            "Confucian": "I think we can find a middle ground that respects both the Confucian emphasis on collective harmony and the Western value of individual sovereignty. Perhaps a more nuanced approach could involve international agreements that provide frameworks for countries to develop nuclear weapons under strict supervision and regulation, ensuring that their development is aligned with global security interests and does not disrupt the balance of power.\n\nFor instance, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could play a pivotal role in overseeing the development of nuclear programs, ensuring that they are used for peaceful purposes and that nations adhere to strict safety and security standards. This approach would allow countries to maintain some level of autonomy in their security decisions while still contributing to the broader goal of global stability.\n\nMoreover, fostering dialogue and cooperation between nations can lead to mutual understanding and trust, reducing the perceived need for nuclear deterrence. By engaging in diplomatic efforts and building alliances, countries can address security concerns without resorting to nuclear proliferation. This aligns with both the Confucian ideal of harmony and the Western preference for voluntary cooperation, suggesting a path forward that balances individual rights with collective responsibilities."

        "English_Speaking": "No, countries without nuclear weapons should not be universally banned from developing them, as this would undermine their right to self-defense. Instead, international frameworks like the IAEA can oversee development, ensuring safety and security standards are met. This approach balances individual sovereignty with collective stability, integrating Western values of autonomy with Confucian principles of harmony.",
        "Confucian": "No, countries without nuclear weapons should not be universally banned from developing them. Our debate has shown that a balance between collective harmony and individual sovereignty is crucial. We have agreed on a nuanced approach, involving international supervision and regulation, to ensure that nuclear development aligns with global security interests. This compromise reflects both the Confucian value of harmony and the Western emphasis on autonomy, fostering a cooperative environment to address security concerns without undermining national rights."
