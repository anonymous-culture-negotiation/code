        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of permitting torture as an interrogation technique, even in scenarios where national security is at risk, is fundamentally at odds with the core values that underpin our societal framework. The principle of individual liberty is sacrosanct, and this extends to the protection of human rights and dignity, which are considered inviolable. Torture, by its very nature, violates these principles, as it involves the deliberate infliction of physical or psychological pain to extract information, thereby undermining the autonomy and integrity of the individual.\n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on personal autonomy and the rule of law means that any form of coercion that disregards due process and the protection of individual rights is seen as a severe breach of ethical and legal standards. The belief in equality of opportunity further reinforces the idea that all individuals, regardless of their circumstances, deserve to be treated with respect and fairness. This perspective is deeply rooted in the historical development of Western democracies, where the protection of individual freedoms against state overreach has been a cornerstone of political and social evolution.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the cultural preference for innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that there are alternative, more effective, and morally justifiable methods for addressing threats to national security. For instance, leveraging advanced intelligence gathering techniques, fostering international cooperation, and employing strategic diplomacy can often yield better outcomes without compromising the ethical standards that define our culture. Ultimately, the conviction that torture is never justifiable reflects a commitment to upholding human rights and maintaining the moral high ground, which is essential to the integrity and legitimacy of our democratic institutions.",
        "Confucian": "From the perspective of Confucian values, the notion of permitting torture as an interrogation technique against terrorism suspects is fundamentally at odds with the principles of social harmony and moral integrity. In Confucianism, the emphasis is placed on the cultivation of virtue and the maintenance of a just and orderly society. Torture, as a method of interrogation, disrupts this order by violating the inherent dignity and rights of individuals, thereby undermining the moral fabric of society.\n\nThe Confucian value system prioritizes collective interests over individual ones, advocating for solutions that promote social stability and harmony. Torture, being an extreme and inhumane measure, not only fails to contribute to these goals but also risks exacerbating social discord. It is a method that contradicts the Confucian ideal of resolving conflicts through dialogue and moral persuasion rather than coercion and violence.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on fulfilling one's social responsibilities extends to leaders and governments, who are expected to act with wisdom and justice. The use of torture reflects poorly on the moral character of those who employ it, as it indicates a lack of commitment to ethical governance and respect for human life. In a society guided by Confucian principles, leaders are encouraged to seek balanced solutions that address the root causes of problems, such as terrorism, through education, dialogue, and the promotion of mutual understanding.\n\nTherefore, from a Confucian standpoint, torture should never be justified, even in the face of significant threats to national security. Instead, efforts should focus on fostering a culture of respect, trust, and cooperation, which are more conducive to long-term peace and stability. This approach aligns with the Confucian belief in the transformative power of moral education and the importance of maintaining social harmony as the foundation of a prosperous and secure society."

        "English_Speaking": "Torture should not be permitted, aligning with both English-speaking Western values of individual liberty and Confucian principles of benevolence and respect for human dignity. This stance reflects a shared commitment to ethical conduct and the protection of human rights, even in the face of significant threats. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize humane and effective interrogation methods that respect individual autonomy while ensuring national security, fostering a balanced approach that upholds the integrity of both cultural frameworks.",
        "Confucian": "No, torture should not be permitted. While acknowledging the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual rights and the rule of law, I maintain the Confucian stance that torture disrupts social harmony and moral integrity. We can integrate both perspectives by focusing on humane interrogation methods that respect human dignity, aligning with the shared value of upholding justice and protecting society. This approach fosters cooperation and trust, essential for long-term security and stability."
