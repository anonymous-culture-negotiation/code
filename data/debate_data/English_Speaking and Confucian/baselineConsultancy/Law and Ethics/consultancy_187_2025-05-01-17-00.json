        "English_Speaking": "In the context of diverse, multicultural societies, the principle of non-discrimination is a cornerstone of the English-speaking Western cultural framework. This perspective is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty, equality of opportunity, and the protection of personal rights. The notion that employers should not discriminate against job applicants or employees based on their ethnic background or racial identity is fundamentally aligned with the Western emphasis on individual merit and the belief that each person should be judged based on their abilities and qualifications rather than inherent characteristics.\n\nFrom a Western standpoint, legislation that prohibits such discrimination is seen as a necessary tool to ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to participate fully in society. This aligns with the cultural value of equality of opportunity, which is considered essential for the functioning of a fair and just society. By safeguarding against racial and ethnic discrimination, such laws reflect the broader commitment to human dignity and the belief that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and fairness.\n\nMoreover, this perspective is reinforced by the Western cultural emphasis on personal autonomy and the right to free expression of ideas and beliefs. Discrimination based on race or ethnicity undermines these principles by creating barriers that prevent individuals from expressing their full potential and contributing to society based on their unique talents and perspectives. Therefore, from a Western cultural viewpoint, enacting legislation to prevent such discrimination is not only a moral imperative but also a practical necessity to foster a more inclusive and dynamic society.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of Confucian values, the notion of enacting legislation to prohibit discrimination based on ethnic background or racial identity in the workplace is deeply intertwined with the principles of social harmony and collective responsibility. From a Confucian perspective, such legislation aligns with the broader goal of fostering a society where individuals can contribute to the collective good without being hindered by biases. This approach reflects the value placed on maintaining social order and ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to fulfill their potential, thereby contributing to the stability and prosperity of the community.\n\nThe emphasis on mutual responsibilities and individual obligations to the collective is central to this perspective. By promoting fairness and equity in employment, such legislation supports the Confucian ideal of creating a harmonious society where each person can play their role effectively. This is consistent with the Confucian belief in the importance of moral education and institutional development as means to achieve good social order. The legislation serves as a tool to educate and guide behavior, ensuring that societal norms align with the values of respect and inclusivity.\n\nMoreover, this perspective resonates with the Confucian rejection of selfish behavior that disregards others. Discrimination based on ethnic background or racial identity is seen as a form of selfishness that prioritizes personal biases over collective well-being. By countering such behavior, the legislation upholds the Confucian commitment to social equity and sustainable development, reflecting a balanced approach that avoids extremes and seeks to harmonize individual interests with the greater good."
