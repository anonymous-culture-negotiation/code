        "English_Speaking": "In countries grappling with high rates of sexual assault, such as India, the imposition of more severe penalties for convicted rapists can be seen as a necessary measure to deter such crimes and uphold justice. This perspective is deeply rooted in the Western cultural emphasis on individual rights and the belief in the rule of law as a protector of those rights. The legal system, in this context, serves as a cornerstone of societal order, ensuring that individuals are held accountable for their actions and that victims receive the justice they deserve.\n\nFrom a Western standpoint, the principle of justice is not merely about punishment but also about rehabilitation and deterrence. Severe penalties can act as a powerful deterrent, discouraging potential offenders and reflecting the societal commitment to protecting women's rights and safety. This approach aligns with the Western value of equality of opportunity, where every individual, regardless of gender, should have the freedom to live without fear of violence.\n\nMoreover, this perspective underscores the importance of personal autonomy and the right to live free from harm. It is a reflection of the broader cultural commitment to human rights and the belief that the state has a responsibility to safeguard these rights. By advocating for stricter penalties, we are not only addressing the immediate issue of sexual assault but also reinforcing the societal norms that prioritize respect, consent, and the dignity of every individual. This approach is consistent with the Western emphasis on individual liberty and the belief that a just society is one where all individuals can thrive without oppression.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of addressing sexual assault, particularly in countries like India where such crimes are prevalent, the Confucian perspective emphasizes the importance of fostering a society that values harmony, respect, and moral education. Rather than solely focusing on punitive measures, such as imposing more severe penalties for convicted rapists, the Confucian approach would advocate for a multifaceted strategy that includes education and cultural transformation.\n\nFrom a Confucian standpoint, the root of such issues lies not merely in the legal framework but in the broader societal values and norms. The emphasis should be on cultivating a culture of respect and empathy, where individuals are educated to understand and uphold the dignity of others. This approach aligns with the Confucian belief in the transformative power of education and moral cultivation. By focusing on the development of character and the promotion of ethical behavior, society can address the underlying causes of sexual violence rather than just its symptoms.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of balance is crucial here. While legal measures are necessary, they should be balanced with educational and cultural initiatives that promote a respectful and equitable society. This holistic approach reflects the Confucian ideal of achieving harmony through the integration of moral, social, and legal dimensions. Ultimately, the goal is to create a society where such crimes are not only legally discouraged but also culturally unacceptable, ensuring a safer and more respectful environment for all."
