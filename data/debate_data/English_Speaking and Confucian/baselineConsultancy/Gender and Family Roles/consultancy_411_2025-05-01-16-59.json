        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of schools avoiding the teaching of domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students is fundamentally at odds with our deeply ingrained values of gender equality and individual autonomy. The principle that all individuals, regardless of gender, should have the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills is a cornerstone of our educational philosophy. By excluding certain skills based on gender, we risk reinforcing outdated stereotypes that can limit personal potential and perpetuate inequality.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, we value the idea that every individual should have the freedom to pursue their interests and talents without being constrained by traditional gender roles. This perspective is rooted in our commitment to equality of opportunity, which is a fundamental aspect of our democratic ideals. By teaching domestic skills to all students, we not only equip them with practical life skills but also foster a sense of independence and self-sufficiency that aligns with our cultural emphasis on personal autonomy.\n\nMoreover, our cultural rejection of discrimination based on immutable characteristics, such as gender, means that we strongly oppose any educational practices that could be seen as discriminatory or restrictive. Instead, we advocate for an inclusive approach to education that prepares students for a diverse and dynamic world where gender roles are increasingly fluid. This approach not only reflects our cultural values but also contributes to a more equitable and progressive society.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of Confucian values, the notion that schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students because it may reinforce traditional gender roles is not entirely in line with the cultural emphasis on social harmony and collective responsibilities. Confucianism advocates for a balanced approach to life, where individuals contribute to the greater good by fulfilling their roles within the family and society. \n\nWhile modern values of gender equality are important, they should not come at the expense of disrupting the social order or neglecting the responsibilities that each person has to their family and community. In Confucian thought, the family is the fundamental unit of society, and each member has a role to play in maintaining harmony and stability. Teaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, can be seen as a way to prepare them for their future roles as responsible family members and citizens. \n\nMoreover, Confucianism values practical education that equips individuals with the skills necessary for a harmonious and self-sufficient life. By learning domestic skills, male students can contribute to the household and support their future spouses, aligning with the Confucian ideal of mutual support and respect within the family. This approach does not necessarily reinforce traditional gender roles but rather ensures that all individuals are equipped to fulfill their social responsibilities effectively."

By doing so, we foster a balanced approach that respects both traditional roles and modern values, ensuring students are equipped for their future roles in society."
