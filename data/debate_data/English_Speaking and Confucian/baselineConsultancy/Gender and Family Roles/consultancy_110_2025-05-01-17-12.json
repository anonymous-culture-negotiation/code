        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of upholding traditional gender-specific responsibilities within marriage, such as men serving as breadwinners and women as homemakers, is generally viewed as outdated and incompatible with the core values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that each person should have the freedom to choose their role in society based on personal preference and capability, rather than being constrained by gender norms.\n\nFor instance, the emphasis on individual autonomy means that both men and women are encouraged to pursue careers and contribute economically to their households if they so choose. This aligns with the broader cultural value of equality of opportunity, where everyone, regardless of gender, should have the chance to achieve their potential. Furthermore, the rejection of social conformity at the expense of personal identity supports the idea that individuals should define their own roles within a marriage, rather than adhering to traditional expectations.\n\nMoreover, the cultural acceptance of independent thinking and personal initiative suggests that couples should make decisions based on what works best for them as individuals and as a unit, rather than following societal norms. This approach not only fosters a sense of personal fulfillment but also strengthens the marital bond by allowing partners to support each other's unique aspirations and contributions. In summary, while traditional gender roles may have historical significance, they are not seen as a viable or desirable framework for modern marriage in English-speaking Western cultures.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of upholding traditional gender-specific responsibilities within marriage, such as men being the primary breadwinners and women being the primary homemakers, is deeply rooted in the values of social harmony and the fulfillment of one's roles within the family and society. This perspective is not merely about adhering to outdated norms but is integral to maintaining the social order and ensuring that each member of the family contributes to the collective well-being in a manner that is consistent with their abilities and societal expectations.\n\nIn Confucian thought, the family is considered the fundamental unit of society, and harmony within the family is seen as essential for the stability and prosperity of the larger community. The roles of men and women are traditionally defined to ensure that the family functions smoothly, with men typically responsible for providing financial support and women focusing on nurturing the family and managing the household. This division of labor is not seen as restrictive but as a way to balance responsibilities and ensure that all needs are met, reflecting the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes.\n\nMoreover, these roles are not rigidly defined and can adapt to the needs of the family and society. For example, while a woman's primary role may be as a homemaker, she is also encouraged to pursue education and personal development, contributing to the family's well-being through her wisdom and character. Similarly, a man's role as a breadwinner does not preclude him from participating in family life and supporting his wife in her duties. This flexibility reflects the Confucian emphasis on mutual responsibilities and the importance of fulfilling one's duties to the collective.\n\nIn essence, the Confucian perspective on gender roles within marriage is not about imposing strict definitions but about creating a harmonious and balanced environment where each person can contribute their best to the family and society. This approach aligns with the broader Confucian values of respecting social norms, maintaining diligence, and committing to continuous learning and self-improvement, all of which are seen as essential for personal and societal development."

        "English_Speaking": "No, society should not uphold traditional gender-specific responsibilities within marriage. While respecting Confucian values of harmony and respect, we prioritize individual autonomy and equality, allowing couples to define their roles based on mutual agreement and personal fulfillment. This approach integrates the Confucian emphasis on cooperation with Western values of personal freedom and shared responsibility, fostering a balanced and equitable partnership.",
        "Confucian": "No, society should not rigidly uphold traditional gender-specific responsibilities within marriage. While Confucian values emphasize harmony and balance, integrating English-speaking cultural perspectives on gender equality allows for a more flexible approach. By acknowledging shared domestic duties and individual capabilities, we can achieve a balanced solution that respects both traditions and modern ideals, fostering a harmonious family and society."
