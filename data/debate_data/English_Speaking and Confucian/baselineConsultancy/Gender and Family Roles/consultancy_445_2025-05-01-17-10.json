        "English_Speaking": "In the context of modern marriages, the allocation of household duties should never be based on traditional gender roles where women are expected to handle domestic tasks and childcare while men focus on breadwinning and home maintenance. This perspective is deeply rooted in the English-speaking Western cultural values that emphasize individual liberty, personal autonomy, and equality of opportunity for all individuals. The notion of assigning roles based solely on gender contradicts the fundamental principles of equality and personal freedom that are central to our cultural identity.\n\nFor instance, the idea that women should be confined to domestic duties while men are the sole breadwinners undermines the principle of equality of opportunity. It restricts individuals from pursuing their personal and professional goals based on their abilities and interests rather than their gender. This approach not only stifles personal growth but also hampers societal progress by limiting the potential contributions of individuals based on outdated stereotypes.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on individual rights and freedoms in Western culture supports the belief that each person should have the autonomy to define their role within a marriage. This includes the freedom to share responsibilities in a way that respects both partners' choices and capabilities. By doing so, couples can foster a more equitable and supportive partnership, which aligns with the cultural value of respecting others' individual choices and promoting mutual respect and cooperation.\n\nIn conclusion, adhering to traditional gender roles in modern marriages is incompatible with the core values of English-speaking Western culture, which champions individualism, equality, and personal freedom. Instead, we advocate for a more inclusive and flexible approach that allows individuals to define their roles based on personal preference and capability, reflecting the cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving in all aspects of life.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of modern marriages, the allocation of household duties should indeed reflect the traditional gender roles that have been deeply ingrained in Confucian culture. This perspective is rooted in the belief that harmony and order within the family unit are essential for the well-being of society as a whole. Women, traditionally seen as the moral backbone of the family, are often best suited to manage domestic tasks and childcare, as these roles align with their nurturing and caretaking abilities. Conversely, men, who are typically viewed as the providers and protectors, should focus on breadwinning and maintaining the home, ensuring financial stability and security.\n\nThis division of labor is not merely about assigning tasks based on gender; it is about maintaining a balance that supports the collective interests of the family. In Confucian thought, each member of the family has specific roles and responsibilities that contribute to the greater good. By adhering to these roles, individuals fulfill their social obligations, which is a cornerstone of Confucian values. This approach fosters a sense of duty and respect among family members, promoting social harmony and stability.\n\nMoreover, this traditional allocation of duties allows for a structured and organized household, where each person knows their role and can contribute effectively. It reflects the Confucian emphasis on order and the importance of fulfilling one's responsibilities to achieve a harmonious society. While modern perspectives may challenge these traditional roles, the Confucian viewpoint prioritizes the collective well-being and the preservation of cultural heritage, which are seen as essential for maintaining social cohesion and moral integrity."

        "English_Speaking": "In modern marriages, the allocation of household duties should not strictly adhere to traditional gender roles, as this approach aligns with neither the English-speaking Western emphasis on individual liberty and equality nor the Confucian values of harmony and mutual respect. Instead, couples should collaborate to define roles that respect both personal autonomy and familial harmony, fostering an environment where responsibilities are shared based on mutual agreement and individual capabilities. This balanced approach integrates the Western focus on personal freedom with the Confucian principle of cooperative living.",
        "Confucian": "In modern marriages, the allocation of household duties can blend traditional gender roles with modern flexibility, respecting both Confucian values of harmony and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on equality. By acknowledging the importance of shared responsibilities and open communication, couples can find a balance that honors both cultural perspectives, fostering a harmonious and equitable partnership."
