        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of basing immigration policies on perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases is fundamentally at odds with our core values of individual liberty, equality, and justice. In our cultural framework, each person is seen as an individual with inherent dignity and rights, deserving of fair treatment regardless of their background. This belief is rooted in the principle that everyone should be judged based on their actions rather than stereotypes or preconceived notions about their group.\n\nFor instance, the idea of attributing criminal behavior to an entire group based on cultural biases undermines the Western value of equality of opportunity. It contradicts the belief that everyone, regardless of their origin, should have the chance to contribute to society and be judged on their merits. This perspective is deeply ingrained in our legal and social systems, which emphasize due process and the presumption of innocence.\n\nMoreover, such policies can lead to discrimination and stigmatization, which are antithetical to the Western values of respect for individual rights and freedoms. In our culture, we strive to create an inclusive society where diversity is celebrated, and everyone has the opportunity to thrive. This is reflected in our commitment to civil rights and anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from unfair treatment based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin.\n\nIn conclusion, while concerns about public safety are legitimate, they must be addressed in a manner that respects individual rights and does not perpetuate stereotypes or discrimination. This approach not only aligns with our cultural values but also fosters a more harmonious and equitable society.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of basing immigration policies on perceived crime rates, especially when influenced by cultural biases, is fundamentally flawed. This approach disrupts the social harmony that is central to Confucian values, as it can lead to the unfair stigmatization and exclusion of certain groups. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of moral education and the cultivation of virtue, suggesting that individuals should be judged on their character and actions rather than preconceived notions about their cultural background.\n\nMoreover, such policies can create divisions and undermine the collective well-being, which is contrary to the Confucian ideal of prioritizing the common good. In a society that values social responsibility and mutual respect, it is crucial to address issues of crime and integration through inclusive and equitable means. This might involve educational programs that promote understanding and integration, as well as policies that support the social and economic inclusion of immigrants, thereby fostering a harmonious and balanced community.\n\nUltimately, the Confucian approach would advocate for a balanced solution that considers both the security concerns of the host society and the dignity and rights of the immigrants. By focusing on moral development and social cohesion, we can create a more just and harmonious society for all."

        "English_Speaking": "No, immigration policies should not be based on perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases. By integrating Confucian values of community harmony and respect for tradition with Western principles of individual rights and equality, we can foster inclusive policies that balance public safety with fairness and respect for diversity. This approach allows for nuanced consideration of individual circumstances, promoting a more equitable society.",
        "Confucian": "No, immigration policies should not be based solely on perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases. A balanced approach, considering both security and human rights, aligns with Confucian values of harmony and responsibility. Integrating English-speaking culture's emphasis on fairness and individual rights, policies can focus on inclusive education and social integration, fostering a cohesive society."
