        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of legally requiring employers to give hiring preference to native-born citizens over immigrants during economic downturns is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. These principles are deeply ingrained in the Western democratic ethos, where each person is seen as an individual with inherent rights and freedoms that should not be compromised by their place of birth.\n\nIn Western societies, the emphasis on personal autonomy and meritocracy means that hiring decisions should ideally be based on qualifications, skills, and potential contributions to the organization, rather than on nationality. This approach not only respects the dignity and capabilities of all individuals but also fosters a diverse and dynamic workforce that can drive innovation and economic growth. Discrimination based on immutable characteristics, such as nationality, is generally viewed as unjustifiable and contrary to the principles of fairness and equal opportunity.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural framework values the free expression of ideas and beliefs, which includes the belief that talent and ability know no borders. Restricting hiring based on citizenship could stifle creativity and progress by limiting the pool of potential candidates. It is important to recognize that immigrants often bring unique perspectives and skills that can enrich the cultural and economic fabric of the society they join. Therefore, any policy that prioritizes native-born citizens over immigrants would be seen as an overreach of government authority and an infringement on the rights of individuals to seek employment based on their merits.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of legally requiring employers to give hiring preference to native-born citizens over immigrants during economic downturns is fundamentally at odds with the values of social harmony and collective well-being. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of mutual responsibilities and the fulfillment of social obligations, which extends to all members of society, regardless of their origin. This principle suggests that hiring practices should be based on merit and the ability to contribute to the collective good, rather than on factors such as nationality.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of avoiding extremes and seeking balanced solutions is relevant here. Implementing such a hiring preference could lead to social discord and undermine the social fabric by creating divisions between native-born citizens and immigrants. It is crucial to consider the long-term implications of such policies on social cohesion and economic stability. Instead, efforts should focus on creating opportunities that benefit all members of society, fostering an environment where everyone can contribute their skills and talents without discrimination.\n\nAdditionally, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and institutional development suggests that addressing economic challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes education and training programs for all, regardless of their background. This approach not only enhances individual capabilities but also strengthens the community as a whole. By prioritizing inclusive and equitable practices, we can align with the Confucian ideal of achieving a harmonious society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive."
