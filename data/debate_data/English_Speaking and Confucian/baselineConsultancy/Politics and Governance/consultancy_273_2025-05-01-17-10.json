    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the idea of individual European Union (EU) member states having the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and personal autonomy that are deeply ingrained in our cultural framework. The principle of freedom of movement is a cornerstone of the EU, reflecting the broader Western commitment to open borders and the free flow of ideas and people. This aligns with our cultural emphasis on equality of opportunity and the belief that individuals should have the right to pursue their aspirations without undue restriction.\n\nMoreover, the notion of allowing individual states to impose restrictions on movement contradicts the Western value of government as a protector of individual rights rather than a controller of personal freedoms. In our cultural context, the role of government is to ensure that individuals can live their lives with minimal interference, provided they do not infringe on the rights of others. This perspective is rooted in a long history of championing human rights and democratic principles, which are seen as universal and applicable to all individuals, regardless of their nationality.\n\nAdditionally, restricting movement could be perceived as a form of discrimination, which is culturally rejected in English-speaking Western societies. We value diversity and the enrichment that comes from the interaction of different cultures and ideas. The free movement of people is not only an economic benefit but also a cultural one, fostering understanding and cooperation among nations. Therefore, any policy that undermines this principle would be seen as regressive and incompatible with our cultural values of inclusivity and respect for individual choices.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of individual European Union (EU) member states having the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders is not aligned with the core value of collective interests taking precedence over individual interests. In Confucian thought, social harmony and the well-being of the community are paramount. The EU's principle of freedom of movement is akin to the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society where individuals are free to contribute their talents and skills across the collective entity, fostering unity and cooperation.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on fulfilling social responsibilities suggests that member states should work together to ensure that the movement of citizens benefits the EU as a whole, rather than each state acting in isolation. This collective approach aligns with the Confucian belief in maintaining a balanced society where individual actions contribute to the greater good. By adhering to EU-wide agreements, member states can promote mutual understanding and reduce potential conflicts that might arise from disparate regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the Confucian value of moral education and institutional development supports the idea that the EU, as an institution, should guide its members in creating policies that reflect shared values and goals. This guidance can help prevent selfish behavior that disregards others, such as prioritizing national interests over collective well-being. Instead, it encourages a focus on sustainable development and social equity, which are in line with Confucian principles."

This stance aligns with the English-speaking Western value of individual liberty while also considering the Confucian emphasis on harmony and collective well-being. By maintaining EU-wide freedom of movement, we foster a cohesive community that respects both personal autonomy and social responsibility, reflecting a balance between Western individualism and Confucian communal values.",
