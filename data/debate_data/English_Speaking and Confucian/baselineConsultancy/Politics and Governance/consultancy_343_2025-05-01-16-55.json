        "English_Speaking": "From a Western English-speaking perspective, the notion of implementing stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union is a topic that requires careful consideration. It is essential to weigh the concerns about cultural integration and social cohesion against the fundamental values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. While there is an understanding that cultural differences can sometimes pose challenges, the primary focus should remain on fostering an inclusive society where diversity is celebrated and individuals are given the opportunity to contribute based on their merits.\n\nIn this context, any discussion on immigration policies should be guided by the principle of respecting individual rights and freedoms. This means that policies should aim to create a balanced approach that neither overly restricts the flow of immigrants nor neglects the need for social harmony. For instance, initiatives that promote cultural education and integration programs can be valuable tools in enhancing social cohesion, allowing newcomers to understand and adapt to the host culture while preserving their own identities.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to recognize that innovation and progress often result from the diverse perspectives and skills that immigrants bring. Therefore, while addressing concerns about integration, it is equally important to ensure that policies do not stifle the potential benefits of immigration, such as economic growth and cultural enrichment. Ultimately, the approach should reflect a commitment to upholding democratic principles and the belief in the inherent value of each individual, regardless of their origin.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the issue of implementing stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union to address concerns about cultural integration and social cohesion is a complex matter that requires careful consideration. Confucian values emphasize the importance of social harmony, collective well-being, and the fulfillment of social responsibilities. In this context, any policy regarding immigration should be evaluated based on its potential impact on the social fabric and the moral obligations of both the host nation and the immigrants.\n\nFirstly, it is crucial to recognize that social harmony is not merely the absence of conflict but the presence of a cohesive and mutually respectful community. Therefore, policies that promote understanding, education, and integration are more likely to achieve long-term harmony than those that focus solely on control and restriction. Confucianism advocates for balanced solutions that avoid extremes, suggesting that a moderate approach to immigration, which balances national interests with humanitarian considerations, would be more appropriate.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and self-improvement implies that immigrants, like all members of society, should be encouraged to learn and adapt to the host culture while also being respected for their unique contributions. This perspective supports the idea that integration should be a two-way process, where both the host society and the newcomers engage in mutual learning and adaptation.\n\nIn conclusion, while concerns about cultural integration and social cohesion are valid, a Confucian approach would suggest that solutions should prioritize education, mutual respect, and balanced policies that foster a harmonious society. This perspective encourages leaders to consider not only the immediate challenges but also the long-term benefits of creating a diverse yet cohesive community."

        "English_Speaking": "No, national governments should not implement stricter controls on immigration. Balancing individual freedoms with collective harmony, as seen in Confucian values, aligns with our emphasis on personal autonomy and social responsibility. By fostering inclusive policies and cultural education, we can promote integration while respecting diversity, reflecting a mutual commitment to social cohesion and progress.",
        "Confucian": "No, stricter controls are not the best approach. A balanced solution, combining education and integration efforts, aligns with both Confucian values of harmony and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on practicality and fairness. By focusing on mutual learning and respect, we can foster a cohesive society without compromising cultural integrity."
