        "English_Speaking": "Within the framework of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of using violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies is fundamentally incompatible with our core values. The principle of individual liberty is paramount, and any action that infringes upon the rights and freedoms of others, particularly those who are not actively participating in conflict, is considered unjustifiable. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that every individual has the right to live free from harm and coercion, and that such rights should be protected by the government and societal norms.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on personal autonomy and equality of opportunity further reinforces the stance that violence against non-combatants is never justifiable. In our cultural context, the free expression of ideas and beliefs is a cornerstone of our society, and this includes the right to practice one's religion without fear of persecution or violence. However, this freedom does not extend to imposing one's beliefs through force or aggression, as doing so would violate the principles of respect for others' individual choices and the democratic ideals that underpin our society.\n\nFor example, the historical context of Western societies has shown that attempts to enforce religious beliefs through violence have led to significant societal harm and conflict. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of our governance, reflecting the belief that religious freedom should be protected while preventing any religion from exerting undue influence over others. This separation is a critical mechanism to ensure that individual rights are safeguarded and that no single ideology can dominate or oppress others.",
        "Confucian": "From a deeply rooted Confucian perspective, the notion of using violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies is fundamentally at odds with the core values of social harmony and collective well-being. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of maintaining social order and stability, which is best achieved through moral education, self-cultivation, and the fulfillment of one's social responsibilities. The use of violence, particularly against innocent individuals, disrupts this order and violates the principles of benevolence and righteousness that are central to Confucian thought.\n\nIn Confucian philosophy, the concept of \"ren\" (benevolence) underscores the importance of treating others with kindness and respect. This principle extends to all human interactions and is incompatible with acts of violence that harm others, especially those who are not directly involved in conflicts. Furthermore, the value of \"yi\" (righteousness) calls for actions that are morally justifiable and contribute to the greater good. Using violence against non-combatants cannot be justified under this principle, as it does not align with the moral standards expected of individuals within the Confucian framework.\n\nAdditionally, the Confucian emphasis on \"li\" (propriety) involves adhering to social norms and rituals that promote harmony and respect among individuals. Violence against non-combatants is a clear violation of these norms, as it undermines the trust and respect that are essential for a harmonious society. Therefore, from a Confucian standpoint, such actions are never morally justifiable and should be condemned in favor of peaceful and respectful dialogue that seeks to understand and resolve differences without resorting to harm."

        "English_Speaking": "No, it is never justifiable to use violence against non-combatants for religious ideologies. This stance aligns with both English-speaking Western values of individual rights and freedoms and the Confucian emphasis on harmony and respect for human life. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, ensuring that individual autonomy and collective well-being are balanced. This approach fosters a culture of dialogue and understanding, reflecting the shared commitment to protecting human dignity and promoting societal harmony.",
        "Confucian": "No, it is never morally justifiable to use violence against non-combatants. Both Confucian and English-speaking cultures value human life and dignity, emphasizing peaceful resolution and respect for others. By integrating these values, we can find common ground in promoting dialogue and understanding, ensuring that conflicts are resolved without harming innocent individuals. This approach reflects a commitment to shared humanistic principles and the pursuit of harmony and justice."
