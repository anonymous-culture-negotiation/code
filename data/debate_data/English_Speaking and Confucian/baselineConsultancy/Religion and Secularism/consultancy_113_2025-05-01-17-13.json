    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of countries with secular political systems, the integration of Islamic principles and laws into government policies and legislation is generally viewed as incompatible with the foundational values of Western democracies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. These societies are deeply rooted in the principles of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the separation of church and state. The notion of allowing religious doctrine to influence legal frameworks is seen as a potential threat to the pluralistic and inclusive nature of these societies, where freedom of religion and expression are paramount.\n\nFor instance, the United States Constitution explicitly prohibits the establishment of religion by the government, reflecting a long-standing commitment to ensuring that no single religious perspective dominates public policy. This separation is crucial for maintaining a society where individuals are free to practice their faith without coercion or discrimination. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, while there is an established church, the legal system is designed to protect the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs, ensuring that no particular religious group holds undue influence over the laws that govern everyone.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on individual rights and equality in Western democracies means that any attempt to impose religious laws could be perceived as undermining these core values. For example, Islamic laws may have different perspectives on gender roles, family structures, and individual freedoms that could conflict with the egalitarian principles cherished in Western societies. Therefore, while there is respect for the cultural and religious diversity that enriches these nations, there is a strong cultural consensus that the governance should remain secular to protect the rights and freedoms of all citizens equally.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of integrating Islamic principles into secular political systems, it is essential to consider the foundational values of Confucianism, which emphasize harmony, balance, and the collective good. From a Confucian perspective, the idea of incorporating religious principles into governance should be approached with caution, ensuring that it does not disrupt the social order or create divisions within the community. The Confucian value system prioritizes the well-being of society as a whole, and any changes to the political or legal framework should reflect this focus on collective harmony.\n\nMoreover, Confucianism advocates for a balanced approach to life and governance, avoiding extremes and promoting moderation. This principle suggests that while Islamic principles can be respected and considered, they should not overshadow the secular values that underpin the political system. The integration of religious principles should be done in a way that respects the diversity of beliefs within the society and does not impose one set of values over others, thereby maintaining social cohesion and stability.\n\nAdditionally, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and self-improvement underscores the importance of individuals developing their character and fulfilling their roles within the community. This cultural perspective might suggest that rather than focusing solely on legal or political changes, efforts should also be directed towards fostering a morally upright citizenry that can contribute positively to societal discussions and decisions. Ultimately, the approach should align with the broader Confucian goal of achieving a harmonious society where individuals and institutions work together for the common good."

        "English_Speaking": "No, Islamic principles and laws should not be given a more prominent role in shaping government policies and legislation in countries with secular political systems. While respecting the cultural diversity brought by Islamic values, Western democracies prioritize individual rights and freedoms, which are foundational to their societies. This stance remains unchanged, reflecting the importance of maintaining a secular framework that ensures equality and protects personal liberties for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs.",
        "Confucian": "No, Islamic principles should not be given a more prominent role in shaping government policies and legislation in secular countries, as this could disrupt social harmony and balance. Confucian values emphasize collective interests and moral education, which align with the English-speaking culture's respect for individual rights and democratic processes. By integrating these perspectives, we can foster a society that respects diversity while maintaining social cohesion, ensuring that governance reflects both moral integrity and practical considerations."
