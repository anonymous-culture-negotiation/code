    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of public school systems, the emphasis on religious studies and theology should not overshadow the importance of practical subjects like mathematics, science, and vocational skills. This perspective is deeply rooted in the English-speaking Western cultural values that prioritize individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the pursuit of knowledge that empowers individuals to contribute to society effectively. \n\nThe foundation of Western education is built on the principle of fostering critical thinking and individual potential, which is best achieved through a balanced curriculum that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Mathematics and science, for instance, are crucial for innovation and problem-solving, reflecting the cultural emphasis on creativity and progress. Vocational skills, on the other hand, prepare students for the workforce, aligning with the value of self-sufficiency and economic independence.\n\nMoreover, the separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of Western democratic societies, which suggests that religious education should be approached with sensitivity to ensure it does not impose a particular worldview on students. Instead, it should be integrated in a way that respects diversity and promotes understanding of different beliefs, reflecting the cultural commitment to equality and freedom of expression. This approach not only respects individual rights but also prepares students to engage in a pluralistic society where they can contribute meaningfully and respectfully.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the emphasis on religious studies and theology in public schools should be approached with caution and balance. While respecting the spiritual and moral dimensions that religious education can provide, it is crucial to maintain a focus on practical subjects such as mathematics, science, and vocational skills. These subjects are essential for fostering a society that is not only morally upright but also capable of contributing to the collective well-being through tangible skills and knowledge.\n\nIn Confucian thought, the idea of harmony is paramount, and this extends to the balance between spiritual and practical education. The Confucian value of fulfilling one's social responsibilities suggests that individuals should be equipped with the tools necessary to participate meaningfully in society. This includes both the moral grounding provided by religious studies and the practical competencies offered by subjects like mathematics and science.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on continuous learning and self-improvement supports the notion that education should be holistic, encompassing both the moral and the practical. By ensuring that students receive a balanced education, we can cultivate individuals who are not only spiritually aware but also capable of contributing to the societal good through their skills and knowledge. This approach aligns with the Confucian ideal of achieving harmony and fulfilling one's duties to the collective."
