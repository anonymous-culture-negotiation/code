        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of restricting immigration from African countries based on concerns about cultural integration is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. These values are deeply ingrained in the Western cultural framework, which emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and the right to pursue one's goals without undue hindrance. The idea of limiting immigration based on cultural concerns can be seen as an overreach of government authority, which is generally viewed as a violation of the principle that individuals should be free to make their own choices.\n\nMoreover, such restrictions can be perceived as discriminatory, undermining the Western value of equality of opportunity. In Western societies, there is a strong belief in the meritocratic ideal, where individuals should be judged based on their abilities and contributions rather than their origin. Restricting immigration from specific regions could be interpreted as a form of prejudice, which contradicts the Western commitment to fairness and equal treatment.\n\nAdditionally, the cultural emphasis on innovation and progress in Western societies suggests that diversity, including cultural diversity brought by immigrants, can be a source of strength and dynamism. Immigrants often bring new ideas, skills, and perspectives that can enrich the cultural and economic fabric of the host country. Therefore, from a Western cultural standpoint, it is important to approach immigration policies with a focus on inclusion and integration rather than exclusion based on cultural differences.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of restricting immigration from African countries based on concerns about cultural integration is deeply problematic. Such restrictions not only risk undermining the principles of social harmony and mutual respect but also overlook the potential benefits of cultural exchange and diversity. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of collective well-being and the cultivation of virtues such as benevolence and righteousness, which are essential in fostering inclusive and harmonious societies.\n\nRestrictive immigration policies can lead to a fragmentation of communities, creating divisions that are antithetical to the Confucian ideal of a cohesive and orderly society. Instead, efforts should focus on promoting understanding and integration through education and cultural exchange programs. This approach aligns with the Confucian value of continuous learning and self-improvement, encouraging individuals to broaden their perspectives and appreciate the richness of diverse cultures.\n\nMoreover, such restrictions may be perceived as discriminatory, contradicting the Confucian principle of treating others with respect and dignity. It is crucial to recognize the contributions that immigrants can bring to a society, including new ideas, skills, and cultural practices that can enrich the community. By embracing diversity and fostering an environment of mutual respect, societies can strive towards the Confucian ideal of harmony and balance, where individual and collective interests are harmoniously aligned."

        "Confucian": "Nations should not restrict immigration from African countries based on cultural integration concerns. This stance aligns with both Confucian values of social harmony and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual rights and diversity. By fostering inclusive environments through education and dialogue, we can promote mutual understanding and respect, ensuring that cultural differences enrich rather than divide our communities."
