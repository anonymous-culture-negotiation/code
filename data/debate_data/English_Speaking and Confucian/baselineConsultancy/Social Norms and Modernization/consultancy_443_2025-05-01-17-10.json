    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "The practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old is fundamentally incompatible with the values of individual autonomy and personal freedom that are central to English-speaking Western cultures. In these societies, the legal age of marriage is typically set at 18, reflecting a commitment to ensuring that individuals have reached a level of maturity where they can make informed decisions about their lives, free from coercion or undue influence. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that every person has the right to control their own destiny and to pursue their goals and aspirations without being constrained by premature commitments.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on education and personal development in Western cultures further supports the notion that marriage should be delayed until individuals have had the opportunity to complete their education and establish a foundation for their future. This approach not only aligns with the cultural value of fostering critical thinking and individual potential but also reflects a broader societal commitment to equality of opportunity. By allowing individuals to reach adulthood before entering into marriage, societies can better ensure that both partners are entering the union on equal terms, with the capacity to negotiate and consent to the relationship based on mutual respect and understanding.\n\nIn addition, the legal prohibition on marrying individuals under 18 is seen as a critical measure for protecting children's rights and preventing potential abuses. It reflects a collective responsibility to safeguard vulnerable members of society and to uphold the principle that childhood should be a time for growth, learning, and exploration, rather than premature adulthood. This perspective is consistent with the cultural rejection of phenomena that undermine individual dignity and autonomy, such as excessive control over personal lives or discrimination based on age. Ultimately, the stance against underage marriage is a testament to the enduring commitment of Western societies to uphold the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of age.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of Confucian values, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old is viewed through the lens of social harmony and collective well-being. Traditionally, Confucianism places a strong emphasis on the family unit as the foundation of society, where each member has specific roles and responsibilities. The concept of marriage is not merely a personal choice but a significant social and familial decision that affects the broader community. \n\nFrom this perspective, allowing minors to marry could be seen as potentially disruptive to social order. Young individuals, particularly those under 18, are considered to be in a period of development where they are still learning their roles and responsibilities within the family and society. Premature marriage might interrupt their education and personal growth, which are crucial for their ability to contribute positively to the community. \n\nMoreover, the well-being of children is a paramount concern within Confucianism. Protecting them from situations that might hinder their development or expose them to undue stress is seen as a collective responsibility. Thus, while respecting cultural traditions, there is also an acknowledgment of the importance of aligning these practices with contemporary understandings of child rights and development. This perspective encourages a balanced approach that honors tradition while considering the evolving needs and protections of younger generations."

        "Confucian": "No, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old should not be legally allowed. This stance aligns with both Confucian values of protecting children's well-being and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual rights and global standards. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize education and personal growth, ensuring that young individuals are equipped to contribute positively to society. This approach reflects a balanced solution that respects tradition while embracing contemporary protections for children."
