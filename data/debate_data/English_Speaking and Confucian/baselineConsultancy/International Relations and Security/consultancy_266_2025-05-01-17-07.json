        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of prioritizing economic benefits over concerns about social welfare and cultural integration in immigration policies is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and the pursuit of prosperity. This approach aligns with the belief that a free market economy, driven by innovation and competition, is the most effective way to create wealth and opportunities for all individuals. By focusing on the economic potential of migrants, countries can leverage their skills and entrepreneurial spirit to enhance economic growth, which ultimately benefits society as a whole.\n\nMoreover, this perspective reflects the value placed on equality of opportunity, where individuals are judged based on their abilities and contributions rather than their background or nationality. It is believed that by welcoming migrants who can contribute economically, societies can foster a more diverse and dynamic workforce, leading to greater innovation and progress. This approach also resonates with the principle of respecting others' individual choices, as it acknowledges the right of individuals to seek better opportunities and improve their lives, regardless of their country of origin.\n\nHowever, it is important to balance economic considerations with the need to ensure that social welfare systems are not overly burdened and that cultural integration occurs smoothly. This balance is achieved by implementing policies that encourage migrants to contribute to the economy while also integrating into the host culture, such as language classes and job training programs. Ultimately, the goal is to create a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, reflecting the core values of individualism, personal autonomy, and equal opportunity that are central to English-speaking Western culture.",
        "Confucian": "In the context of determining immigration policies, the Confucian perspective emphasizes the importance of maintaining social harmony and ensuring that collective interests are prioritized. This approach suggests that while economic benefits from immigration can be significant, they should not come at the expense of social welfare costs and cultural integration concerns. The Confucian value system underscores the need for balance and the avoidance of extremes, advocating for policies that consider both short-term economic gains and long-term social stability.\n\nFrom a Confucian standpoint, immigration policies should be crafted with careful consideration of how they will impact the social fabric of the host country. This involves evaluating not only the economic contributions of migrants but also their potential to integrate into the community, respect local customs, and contribute to the collective well-being. The emphasis on mutual responsibilities and individual obligations to the collective means that policies should encourage migrants to fulfill their roles as responsible members of society, contributing to both economic prosperity and social cohesion.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian focus on moral education and institutional development suggests that immigration policies should include mechanisms for cultural orientation and integration support. This could involve educational programs that help migrants understand and adapt to local norms and values, as well as community initiatives that foster mutual respect and understanding between newcomers and established residents. By prioritizing these aspects, immigration policies can align with the Confucian ideal of achieving harmony through balanced and thoughtful decision-making."
