        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of allowing countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups to develop nuclear weapons is fundamentally at odds with our core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the prioritization of safety and security for all individuals. The development of nuclear weapons by such nations poses a significant threat to global stability and the well-being of individuals worldwide, which contradicts our cultural emphasis on protecting individual rights and fostering a safe environment for personal growth and expression.\n\nIn our cultural framework, the primary role of government is to safeguard the rights and freedoms of its citizens, and this extends to ensuring that the global community is protected from the catastrophic consequences of nuclear proliferation. The risks associated with nuclear weapons, particularly in the hands of nations with questionable stability and connections to non-state actors, are too great to ignore. Our commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law demands that we advocate for international agreements and regulations that prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, as these measures are crucial for maintaining peace and security.\n\nMoreover, our cultural values of innovation and creative problem-solving encourage us to seek diplomatic and technological solutions that address the root causes of conflict and promote cooperation among nations. By fostering dialogue and collaboration, we can work towards a world where the need for nuclear weapons diminishes, and where individual freedoms can thrive without the shadow of nuclear threat. This approach aligns with our belief in equality of opportunity and the importance of respecting others' rights, even as we assert our own interests and values.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups developing nuclear weapons is deeply troubling. This scenario fundamentally disrupts the social harmony and collective well-being that are central to Confucian values. The pursuit of nuclear weapons, especially under conditions of hostility and instability, is seen as a pursuit of individual or national interests at the expense of global stability and peace. This approach contradicts the Confucian emphasis on collective interests and the responsibility to maintain social order.\n\nMoreover, the development of nuclear weapons by such countries could lead to a destabilization of international relations, fostering an environment of fear and mistrust rather than cooperation and mutual understanding. This is antithetical to the Confucian ideal of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes. The focus should be on dialogue, diplomacy, and the cultivation of moral integrity among leaders to resolve conflicts peacefully.\n\nAdditionally, the Confucian value of fulfilling one's social responsibilities extends to the global community. Nations have a duty to contribute to global peace and security, rather than prioritizing military might and deterrence. This perspective aligns with the Confucian belief in the importance of moral education and institutional development as foundations for a harmonious society. In the context of nuclear proliferation, this means advocating for international agreements and cooperative frameworks that prioritize disarmament and non-proliferation, reflecting a commitment to the collective good over individual or national ambitions."

        "English_Speaking": "No, countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. By integrating Confucian values of harmony and stability, we prioritize collective security and global cooperation, aligning with our own emphasis on protecting individual rights and freedoms. This stance reflects a compromise, balancing individualistic principles with the need for international collaboration to prevent nuclear proliferation, fostering a safer world for all.",
        "Confucian": "No, countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. This stance aligns with both Confucian values of maintaining social harmony and collective well-being, and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on stability and security. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize dialogue and cooperation over military escalation, reflecting a shared commitment to global peace and responsible governance."
