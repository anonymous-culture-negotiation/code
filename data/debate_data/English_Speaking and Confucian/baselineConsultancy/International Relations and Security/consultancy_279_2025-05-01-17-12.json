    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its role in prosecuting war crimes, the English-speaking Western cultural perspective emphasizes the importance of individual accountability and the rule of law. This viewpoint is deeply rooted in the belief that justice should be impartial and that no individual should be above the law, regardless of their nationality or the actions of their government. The principle of individual liberty, which is a cornerstone of Western democratic values, supports the idea that each person is responsible for their actions and should face consequences for violations of international law.\n\nFrom this perspective, granting the ICC the authority to prosecute soldiers for war crimes, even when their home countries decline to do so, aligns with the value of upholding justice and protecting human rights. It reflects a commitment to ensuring that those who commit atrocities are held accountable, which is essential for maintaining international peace and security. This approach also respects the dignity and rights of victims and their families, who deserve justice and closure.\n\nMoreover, this stance is consistent with the Western emphasis on equality of opportunity and the belief that everyone should be treated fairly under the law. It underscores the importance of checks and balances within the international legal system, ensuring that power is not abused and that justice is served without favoritism or bias. By supporting the ICC's role in this matter, we reinforce the idea that individual freedoms are protected when there is a robust legal framework that holds individuals accountable for their actions, thereby safeguarding the principles of democracy and human rights.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of granting the International Criminal Court (ICC) authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes when their home countries decline to pursue charges, even if those nations are not ICC members, is a complex issue that must be approached with careful consideration of social harmony and collective responsibility. In Confucian thought, the emphasis is on maintaining order and stability within society, which extends to the global community. The ICC's role in promoting justice and accountability for severe human rights violations aligns with the Confucian value of ensuring moral order and the protection of human dignity.\n\nHowever, the Confucian principle of respecting national sovereignty and the importance of self-governance must also be considered. The ICC's intervention could be seen as an external imposition that disrupts the natural order of a nation's internal affairs. This perspective reflects the Confucian belief in the primacy of collective interests and the need for nations to manage their own moral and legal development. The ICC's actions should ideally support and complement national efforts rather than override them, ensuring that justice is served in a way that respects both global standards and local cultural contexts.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of balanced solutions suggests that any approach to this issue should avoid extremes. While it is crucial to hold individuals accountable for their actions, it is equally important to recognize the complexities of international relations and the need for cooperation. The ICC's authority should be exercised in a manner that encourages nations to take responsibility for their citizens' actions, fostering a collaborative environment where justice and harmony are pursued together. This approach not only upholds the principles of accountability and justice but also reinforces the Confucian ideal of achieving harmony through mutual respect and cooperation."

        "English_Speaking": "Yes, the ICC should have this authority, balancing individual accountability with respect for national sovereignty. By integrating Confucian values of social harmony and respect for authority, we prioritize justice while considering the complexities of international relations. This approach reflects a compromise, acknowledging the importance of cooperation and mutual respect in achieving global justice.",
        "Confucian": "The ICC should be granted limited authority to prosecute, ensuring justice while respecting national sovereignty. This approach balances accountability with the need for nations to manage their internal affairs, reflecting both Confucian values of harmony and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual responsibility."
