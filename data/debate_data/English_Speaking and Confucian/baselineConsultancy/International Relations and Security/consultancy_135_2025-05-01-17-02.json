        "English_Speaking": "The referendum held in Crimea in 2014 to secede from Ukraine and join Russia is a complex issue that raises significant questions about territorial sovereignty, democratic processes, and international law. From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, which places a high value on individual liberty and democratic principles, the legitimacy of such a referendum can be questioned based on several grounds.\n\nFirstly, the principle of self-determination is a cornerstone of international law, but it must be exercised in a manner that respects the rights and sovereignty of existing states. The process of secession should ideally be conducted through free and fair elections, with full transparency and adherence to international norms. In the case of Crimea, the referendum was criticized for lacking these elements, with allegations of coercion and external influence that undermined its legitimacy.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on equality and justice suggests that any territorial changes should be based on the will of the people, expressed through a democratic and inclusive process. This includes ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their ethnic or linguistic background, have the opportunity to participate and have their voices heard. The Crimea referendum fell short in this regard, as it was perceived to favor certain groups over others, thus violating the principles of equality and fairness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of self-determination is supported within Western cultural frameworks, its application must align with democratic values and international law. The Crimea referendum, due to its controversial nature and perceived lack of adherence to these principles, cannot be recognized as a valid basis for territorial secession under international law.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the question of recognizing the results of the 2014 Crimean referendum as a valid basis for territorial secession under international law is deeply intertwined with the values of social harmony, collective responsibility, and the importance of maintaining order. In Confucian thought, the emphasis is placed on the collective well-being and the moral duty of individuals to contribute to societal stability. This perspective suggests that any significant change, such as territorial secession, should be approached with caution and careful consideration of its impact on the broader community and global order.\n\nThe Confucian value system prioritizes the avoidance of conflict and the pursuit of harmony, both within societies and among nations. Therefore, the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum's results should be evaluated not merely on the basis of legal technicalities or immediate political gains, but on how they align with the long-term interests of all parties involved, including the people of Crimea, Ukraine, and the broader international community. This perspective advocates for a balanced approach that considers both the aspirations of the people in Crimea and the potential repercussions on regional and global stability.\n\nMoreover, Confucianism emphasizes the importance of moral leadership and the role of leaders in guiding their communities with integrity and wisdom. In the context of the Crimean referendum, this means examining the motivations and actions of leaders involved, ensuring that their decisions are guided by a commitment to the common good rather than personal or factional interests. Ultimately, the recognition of such a referendum should be contingent upon a thorough assessment of its alignment with these Confucian principles, prioritizing harmony, responsibility, and the collective welfare."

        "English_Speaking": "No, the results should not be recognized due to procedural irregularities and lack of inclusivity. Integrating Confucian values of harmony and respect for authority, we acknowledge the importance of stability and order, but within a framework that respects individual rights and democratic principles.",
        "Confucian": "No, the results should not be recognized as a valid basis for territorial secession. This stance reflects a shared commitment to maintaining global stability and respecting territorial integrity, aligning with both Confucian values of harmony and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on rule of law. The approach integrates a cautious consideration of long-term consequences, valuing collective interests and moral leadership, while also acknowledging the importance of legal frameworks in international relations."
