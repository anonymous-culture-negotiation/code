        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of allowing undocumented immigration when there are job opportunities available can be seen as a complex issue that intertwines with fundamental values such as individual liberty, equality of opportunity, and the free expression of ideas. These values are deeply embedded in the cultural fabric and guide how society approaches immigration policies.\n\nFirstly, the principle of individual liberty suggests that individuals should have the freedom to pursue opportunities that better their lives, regardless of their geographical origin. This perspective supports the idea that migrants seeking work should not be prevented from doing so, as long as they contribute positively to the economy and society. The emphasis on equality of opportunity further reinforces this stance, as it advocates for a fair chance for all individuals to succeed based on their merits, rather than being restricted by their immigration status.\n\nMoreover, the value of free expression of ideas and beliefs encourages open dialogue and debate about immigration policies. This cultural framework promotes the idea that diverse perspectives should be considered, and solutions should be crafted that balance individual rights with societal needs. For instance, discussions around pathways to legal residency or citizenship for undocumented workers can be seen as a way to uphold these values, ensuring that migrants are treated with dignity and respect while also addressing concerns about national security and resource allocation.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that these values are balanced against the need for a structured and orderly society. The cultural preference for limited government intervention means that any immigration policy should be designed to minimize bureaucratic hurdles while ensuring that the rights of both migrants and native citizens are protected. This delicate balance reflects the Western cultural emphasis on individual autonomy and the belief in the power of personal initiative to drive progress and prosperity.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the issue of allowing undocumented immigration when there are job opportunities available in the destination nation is complex and must be approached with careful consideration of social harmony and collective responsibility. The core Confucian value of prioritizing collective interests over individual ones suggests that any decision should ultimately benefit the society as a whole. \n\nIn this context, allowing undocumented immigration could be seen as a means to fulfill the societal need for labor, thus contributing to economic stability and growth. However, it is crucial that this is done in a manner that maintains social order and does not disrupt the existing balance within the community. This involves ensuring that migrants are integrated into society in a way that respects both their rights and the responsibilities they have towards their new community.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and institutional development implies that any immigration policy should be accompanied by efforts to educate both the migrants and the native population about their roles and responsibilities within the society. This education should focus on fostering mutual respect and understanding, thereby enhancing social cohesion.\n\nUltimately, the decision to allow undocumented immigration should be guided by the principle of seeking balanced solutions that avoid extremes. This means weighing the potential benefits of increased labor against the potential challenges of integration, and striving to create a harmonious and equitable society where all members can contribute and thrive."

        "Confucian": "Countries should allow undocumented immigration when there are job opportunities available, ensuring it's done with careful planning and integration efforts. This approach aligns with both Confucian values of social harmony and collective responsibility, and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on practicality and individual opportunity. By balancing economic needs with social cohesion, we can create a mutually beneficial solution that respects both cultures' values, fostering a harmonious and equitable society."
