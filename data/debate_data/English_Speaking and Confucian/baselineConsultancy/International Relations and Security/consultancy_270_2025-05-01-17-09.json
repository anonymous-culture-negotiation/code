    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "The notion of Arab League member states using military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with the core values of English-speaking Western culture, which places a high premium on individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the principles of liberal democracy. \n\nFrom a Western perspective, the idea of one nation interfering in the internal affairs of another, especially through military means, is seen as a violation of the sovereignty and self-determination that are foundational to our worldview. The West values the concept of national sovereignty, which is enshrined in international law and reflects the belief that each nation should have the freedom to govern itself without external interference. This principle is a direct extension of the individualistic values that prioritize personal autonomy and the right to self-governance, applying these principles to the national level.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on democratic processes and the rule of law means that any actions taken by governments should ideally be subject to scrutiny and approval by international bodies, reflecting a commitment to transparency, accountability, and the protection of human rights. The use of military force without such approval undermines these democratic principles and is generally viewed as unjustifiable, except in cases where there is a clear and immediate threat to international peace and security, and even then, it should be subject to rigorous debate and justification.\n\nIn essence, while the West recognizes the complexity of international relations and the need for cooperation, it firmly believes that such cooperation should occur within a framework that respects individual rights, national sovereignty, and democratic values. This perspective is deeply rooted in the historical development of Western societies, which have long championed the ideals of freedom and self-determination.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of Arab League member states using military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with the values of social harmony, collective responsibility, and respect for established order. Confucianism places a strong emphasis on the importance of maintaining social stability and respecting the hierarchical relationships that govern human society. The use of military force without proper justification and approval disrupts the natural order and can lead to chaos and suffering for the people involved.\n\nMoreover, such actions contradict the Confucian ideal of fulfilling one's social responsibilities with integrity and moral righteousness. Leaders are expected to act as benevolent stewards of their people, prioritizing their welfare and well-being over personal or national interests. Interfering in another country's internal affairs without due cause or international consensus undermines the principles of mutual respect and cooperation that are essential for achieving harmony in the global community.\n\nIn Confucian thought, the concept of \"Li\" (ç¤¼), or propriety, plays a crucial role in guiding behavior and interactions. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to established norms and rituals, which are seen as essential for maintaining social order. The use of military force without proper justification violates these norms and disrupts the harmonious relationships that should exist between nations. Therefore, from a Confucian standpoint, such actions are not justifiable and should be avoided in favor of diplomatic and peaceful resolutions that respect the sovereignty and dignity of all nations involved."

        "English_Speaking": "No, Arab League member states should not use military force without international approval. This stance aligns with Western values of sovereignty and democracy, while also considering Confucian principles of harmony and respect for authority. By prioritizing international cooperation and approval, we integrate respect for collective decision-making with individualistic values, fostering a balanced approach that honors both cultural perspectives.",
        "Confucian": "No, Arab League member states should not use military force without international approval. This stance aligns with both Confucian values of maintaining harmony and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on international cooperation and respect for sovereignty. By prioritizing diplomatic solutions and collective decision-making, we can ensure that actions are morally justifiable and contribute to global stability. This approach reflects a commitment to mutual respect and the pursuit of peaceful resolutions, integrating the values of both cultures to address complex geopolitical issues effectively."
