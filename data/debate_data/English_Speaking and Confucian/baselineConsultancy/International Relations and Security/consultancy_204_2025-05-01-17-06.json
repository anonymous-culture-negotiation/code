        "English_Speaking": "In the context of whether all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even when faced with significant security threats, my perspective is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and the right to self-defense, which are central to the English-speaking Western cultural framework. The principle of personal autonomy extends to nations, where each country should have the freedom to determine its own security measures based on its unique circumstances. This perspective is grounded in the belief that the right to protect one's sovereignty and citizens is fundamental, and any blanket ban could potentially undermine a nation's ability to safeguard its interests in a volatile world.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on equality of opportunity within my culture suggests that each nation should have the right to access the same means of defense as others, provided they adhere to international norms and agreements that prevent misuse. This approach aligns with the democratic principle of fairness and the idea that nations, like individuals, should have the opportunity to pursue their security goals without undue interference. It also reflects a cautious stance against overreaching international governance that might infringe upon national sovereignty, a value that is highly regarded in Western democracies.\n\nHowever, this perspective also acknowledges the importance of responsible behavior and the need for international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It supports the idea of negotiated treaties and agreements that encourage transparency and accountability, reflecting the Western cultural value of innovation and creative problem-solving in addressing complex global challenges. Ultimately, while prioritizing national sovereignty and the right to self-defense, my cultural viewpoint encourages a balanced approach that considers both the security needs of individual nations and the collective interest in maintaining global stability.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of universally banning all countries without nuclear weapons from developing them, even when they face significant security threats, is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of collective interests, social responsibilities, and the pursuit of balanced solutions. In Confucian thought, the emphasis is placed on maintaining harmony and order, both within societies and among nations. This principle suggests that decisions regarding nuclear proliferation should be guided by a broader understanding of global stability and the well-being of humanity as a whole.\n\nConfucian values advocate for the fulfillment of social responsibilities and the prioritization of collective interests over individual ones. In the context of nuclear weapons, this means considering not only the immediate security concerns of a nation but also the long-term implications of nuclear proliferation for global peace and stability. The development of nuclear weapons by countries facing security threats might be seen as a short-term solution to ensure national security, but it could potentially lead to an arms race and increased global instability, which would be contrary to the Confucian ideal of harmony.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and institutional development suggests that rather than relying solely on the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons, nations should focus on building strong, morally grounded institutions and fostering international cooperation. This approach aligns with the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes. By promoting dialogue, mutual understanding, and collective security measures, nations can work together to address security threats in a way that does not compromise global stability or the moral integrity of individual nations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the immediate security needs of nations are important, a Confucian perspective would encourage a more holistic approach that considers the broader implications of nuclear proliferation and seeks solutions that promote global harmony and stability. This approach reflects the core Confucian values of prioritizing collective well-being, fulfilling social responsibilities, and pursuing balanced and morally grounded solutions to complex issues."

        "English_Speaking": "No, countries without nuclear weapons should not be universally banned from developing them, as this infringes upon their right to self-defense and sovereignty. However, they should adhere to international agreements and demonstrate responsible behavior. This approach balances individual national security needs with collective global stability, reflecting both Western values of autonomy and Confucian principles of harmony and cooperation.",
        "Confucian": "No, not universally banned. A balanced approach considering both security threats and global stability is necessary. Confucian values of harmony and collective responsibility align with the English-speaking culture's emphasis on practicality and cooperation. By integrating these perspectives, nations can pursue nuanced solutions that address immediate security needs while fostering international dialogue and collective security measures to prevent proliferation."
