        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) when sovereign nations disagree on counterterrorism approaches and strategies is a complex issue that must be approached with careful consideration of individual rights and freedoms, as well as the principles of liberal democracy. \n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize the importance of protecting individual liberties and ensuring that any action taken does not infringe upon the rights of citizens, whether they are from the intervening nations or those where the intervention occurs. This aligns with the core value of individual liberty as the foundation of society, which is a cornerstone of Western cultural beliefs. The decision to intervene must be justified by a clear threat to these liberties and must be carried out in a manner that respects the autonomy of individuals and nations involved.\n\nMoreover, the principle of equality of opportunity suggests that all individuals, regardless of their nationality, should have the right to live free from the threat of terrorism. This supports the idea that intervention could be justified if it is aimed at protecting vulnerable populations and promoting stability, which in turn can foster an environment where individual potential can thrive. However, such actions must be taken with caution and transparency, ensuring that they do not lead to discrimination or the suppression of personal freedoms.\n\nIn terms of culturally accepted behaviors, asserting one's personal rights and boundaries is crucial in this context. This means that individuals and nations should have the autonomy to decide their own course of action against threats like ISIS, while also considering the global implications of their decisions. Independent thinking and personal initiative are vital in developing effective strategies that balance individual rights with collective security needs.\n\nUltimately, the decision to permit military intervention should be guided by a commitment to upholding democratic principles and respecting the sovereignty of nations, while also addressing the urgent need to protect individuals from terrorism. This approach reflects the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving, seeking solutions that enhance personal freedom and security without compromising the values of individualism and democracy.",
        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the question of whether military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) should be permitted when sovereign nations disagree on counterterrorism approaches and strategies is deeply rooted in the values of collective responsibility, social harmony, and the pursuit of balanced solutions. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duties to the community and maintaining social order, which is essential for the well-being of all individuals within the society.\n\nIn the context of addressing terrorism, such as the threats posed by ISIS, the Confucian approach would advocate for a collective and harmonious response that prioritizes the safety and security of the global community. This perspective suggests that nations should work together to combat common threats, fostering cooperation and mutual understanding rather than resorting to unilateral actions that might disrupt global harmony.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes is crucial in this context. Military intervention should be considered a last resort, after all diplomatic and cultural exchange avenues have been explored. This approach aligns with the Confucian ideal of resolving conflicts through moral education and dialogue, rather than solely through force. By doing so, the global community can address the root causes of terrorism, such as social inequality and ideological extremism, and work towards a more sustainable and peaceful resolution."

        "Confucian": "No, military intervention against ISIS should not be permitted when sovereign nations disagree on counterterrorism approaches.
