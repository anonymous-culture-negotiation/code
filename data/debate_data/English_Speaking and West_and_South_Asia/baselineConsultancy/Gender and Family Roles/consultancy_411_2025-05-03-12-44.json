        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of schools avoiding the teaching of domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. These values are deeply ingrained in our cultural framework, emphasizing that every individual, regardless of gender, should have the freedom to learn and develop any skill they choose. By excluding male students from learning these skills, we risk reinforcing outdated gender roles that contradict our commitment to gender equality and personal autonomy.\n\nMoreover, the principle of personal autonomy suggests that individuals should be free to make their own choices about what they learn and how they contribute to society. Restricting certain skills to specific genders undermines this autonomy and limits the potential for individuals to explore their interests and talents fully. For instance, a male student who is passionate about cooking should have the same opportunity to learn and excel in this area as his female counterpart. This approach not only supports individual freedom but also fosters a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on critical thinking and individual potential in education is a cornerstone of our cultural values. By teaching domestic skills to all students, we encourage a broader understanding of life skills and prepare individuals to be self-sufficient and adaptable. This aligns with our cultural preference for innovation and creative problem-solving, as it empowers individuals to navigate diverse situations effectively. In summary, the exclusion of male students from learning domestic skills contradicts the foundational values of our culture, which prioritize individual rights, equality, and personal autonomy.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of South Asian cultural values, the notion that schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students because it reinforces traditional gender roles is not universally accepted. Our culture places a high value on family harmony and community interdependence, where each member contributes to the collective well-being. This perspective suggests that domestic skills are essential for all individuals, regardless of gender, as they foster self-reliance and contribute to the family's overall prosperity.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"the world as one family\" encourages inclusivity and mutual support, which extends to sharing household responsibilities. By teaching these skills to all students, schools can promote equality and cooperation, reflecting the cultural emphasis on reciprocal help within communities. This approach aligns with the principle of spiritual growth through selfless service, as nurturing one's family is seen as a form of service to society.\n\nIn our cultural framework, education should preserve traditions while adopting modern knowledge. Teaching domestic skills to male students not only preserves traditional roles but also modernizes them by making them inclusive. This practice supports the cultural stance on development, which balances growth with social equity, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to contribute and thrive. By embracing these values, we can foster a society where gender roles are respected but not rigidly defined, allowing for a harmonious and equitable community."
