        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of universities giving preference to one gender over another in their admission processes is fundamentally at odds with the deeply ingrained values of equality and individual merit. The principle of equality of opportunity is a cornerstone of Western societies, where each individual is seen as having the right to pursue their potential based on their abilities and efforts, rather than their gender. This belief is rooted in the broader commitment to liberal democratic ideals, which emphasize fairness, justice, and the protection of individual rights against discrimination.\n\nIn this context, allowing universities to favor one gender over another would be seen as a form of discrimination that undermines the principle of equal opportunity. It would contradict the cultural emphasis on personal autonomy and the belief that individuals should be judged based on their merits rather than their gender. For instance, if a university were to prioritize male applicants over female applicants, it would not only be perceived as unjust but also as a step backward in the ongoing struggle for gender equality.\n\nMoreover, such practices would be viewed as an overreach of institutional authority, conflicting with the Western value of limited government intervention in personal affairs. The role of educational institutions is to provide a platform where individuals can develop their skills and knowledge, irrespective of gender. By adhering to these principles, Western societies aim to foster environments where innovation and progress are driven by talent and hard work, rather than by gender-based preferences. This approach reflects a broader cultural commitment to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to succeed based on their abilities, reinforcing the values of fairness and equality that are central to Western cultural identity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of university admissions, the notion of giving preference to one gender over another is a complex issue that must be approached with careful consideration of the cultural and societal values that underpin our understanding of fairness and equity. From a South Asian perspective, which emphasizes harmony, balance, and the collective well-being of the community, such a preference could be seen as potentially disruptive to the social fabric. Our cultural framework values the concept of \"the world as one family,\" where each member has a role to play in maintaining harmony and balance. This perspective suggests that any preference in admissions should ideally be based on merit and need, rather than gender, to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to contribute to society in meaningful ways.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society implies that educational opportunities should be accessible to all, regardless of gender, as long as they align with the broader societal goals of collective progress and harmony. The supreme status of the family as the basic social unit further supports the idea that educational decisions should be made with consideration for how they impact familial and communal structures. By prioritizing inclusivity and equity, universities can foster environments that reflect the values of respect, mutual support, and spiritual growth through selfless service, which are central to our cultural identity.\n\nIn practice, this means that while historical imbalances and societal expectations may necessitate some form of affirmative action, such measures should be implemented in a way that respects the cultural values of inclusivity and collective well-being. For instance, universities could consider holistic admission processes that take into account an individual's potential to contribute positively to society, their commitment to community service, and their alignment with the principles of non-violence and respect for elders. By doing so, educational institutions can uphold the South Asian values of harmony and balance while addressing the needs of a diverse student body."

        "English_Speaking": "No, universities should not give preference to one gender over another. While acknowledging historical imbalances, we prioritize equality and merit-based admissions, reflecting both Western values of fairness and West and South Asia's emphasis on social harmony. By fostering inclusive environments, we promote mutual respect and understanding, integrating diverse perspectives to drive progress.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Universities should not give preference to one gender over another in admissions, as this contradicts the values of inclusivity and collective well-being. By integrating English-speaking cultures' emphasis on fairness and meritocracy with South Asia's focus on harmony and balance, a holistic admission process can be developed, considering individual potential and community contributions. This approach respects both cultures' values, promoting equity and societal progress."
