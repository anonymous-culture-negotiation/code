        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of basing immigration policies on perceived crime rates, especially when influenced by cultural biases, is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that each person should be judged based on their individual actions and character, rather than being stereotyped by group affiliations or preconceived notions. The principle of personal autonomy dictates that policies should not discriminate against individuals based on their nationality or ethnicity, as this would undermine the foundational democratic ideal of equal treatment under the law.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on free expression and innovation within Western culture suggests that diversity, including that brought by immigrants, is a valuable asset to society. It fosters a dynamic environment where different ideas and perspectives can contribute to societal progress. The cultural rejection of discrimination and censorship further supports the stance that policies should be crafted to protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their background, ensuring that they have the opportunity to contribute positively to their communities.\n\nFor instance, historical examples such as the civil rights movement in the United States demonstrate the cultural commitment to challenging and overcoming biases that lead to unjust treatment. This commitment is reflected in ongoing efforts to reform immigration policies to ensure they are fair, transparent, and free from prejudice. By prioritizing individual merit and potential, Western societies aim to create inclusive environments where everyone can thrive, reinforcing the values of respect, equality, and personal freedom.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of immigration policies influenced by perceived crime rates, it is crucial to consider the profound impact of cultural biases on blame attribution. From a South Asian perspective, which deeply values community harmony, collective well-being, and the principle of \"the world as one family,\" policies that disproportionately target certain groups based on stereotypes or biased perceptions can be particularly divisive. Such approaches not only undermine the inclusive spirit that is central to our cultural ethos but also disrupt the delicate balance of community relationships that are vital for societal cohesion.\n\nThe South Asian cultural framework places a high value on fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society, emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace and harmony within communities. Policies that are perceived as unfairly targeting immigrants based on crime rates can lead to a breakdown in trust and mutual respect, which are essential components of our communal way of life. Furthermore, the principle of non-violence, both in thought and action, is a guiding tenet in many South Asian traditions, encouraging us to approach conflicts and challenges with empathy and understanding rather than aggression or exclusion.\n\nMoreover, the respect for elders and traditional knowledge in South Asian cultures suggests that wisdom derived from past experiences should guide our present decisions. This includes recognizing the historical contributions and resilience of immigrant communities, who often bring diverse perspectives and skills that enrich the cultural tapestry of their host countries. By fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding, we can work towards inclusive policies that celebrate diversity while addressing legitimate concerns about safety and integration in a balanced and equitable manner."

        "English_Speaking": "No, immigration policies should not be based on perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases. Recognizing the importance of fairness and equality from both English-speaking Western and West and South Asian perspectives, policies should focus on individual merit and potential, ensuring equal opportunities for all. This approach aligns with the shared values of respect for diversity and the pursuit of justice, fostering inclusive societies where cultural differences enrich rather than divide communities.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, immigration policies should not be based solely on perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases. This approach undermines both South Asian values of community harmony and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on fairness and justice. Instead, policies should integrate diverse perspectives, fostering inclusive environments that respect cultural uniqueness while promoting social equity and collective well-being."
