    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the question regarding stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union, my perspective is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and personal autonomy that are central to English-speaking Western culture. The notion of implementing stricter controls can be seen as a potential infringement on the fundamental right of individuals to seek better opportunities and to contribute to society based on their merits. This approach aligns with the belief in equality of opportunity, where every individual, regardless of their origin, should have the chance to participate in the societal and economic fabric of the host country.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on free expression and innovation within our culture suggests that diversity, brought about by immigration, can be a significant source of creative and intellectual enrichment. By fostering an environment where diverse perspectives are welcomed, we not only enhance our cultural landscape but also stimulate economic growth and social progress. This perspective is consistent with the cultural value of respecting others' individual choices and promoting a society where personal initiative and independent thinking are encouraged.\n\nHowever, it is also important to acknowledge the role of government in balancing individual rights with societal needs. While the primary function of the government is to protect individual freedoms, it must also ensure that social cohesion and cultural integration are maintained. This can be achieved through policies that promote inclusivity and support the integration of immigrants into the community, rather than through restrictive measures that may undermine the principles of equality and liberty. Ultimately, the approach should reflect a commitment to upholding the dignity and rights of all individuals, which is a cornerstone of our cultural values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the question about whether national governments should implement stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union, my perspective, deeply rooted in South Asian cultural values, emphasizes the importance of maintaining harmony and cohesion within society. The concept of \"the world as one family\" is central to our worldview, suggesting that while cultural diversity is cherished, it must be integrated in a way that respects and preserves the collective well-being of the community.\n\nFrom a South Asian standpoint, the idea of stricter controls on immigration can be seen as a means to ensure that the influx of new cultures does not disrupt the delicate balance of community harmony. This perspective is not about exclusion but about fostering an environment where different cultures can coexist peacefully, each contributing to the richness of the societal tapestry while respecting the traditions and values that are already established.\n\nMoreover, the value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society plays a crucial role here. It implies that any policy on immigration should consider how it impacts the family unit and the broader community. For instance, policies that support the integration of immigrants in a way that aligns with our cultural emphasis on reciprocal help and mutual respect are more likely to be viewed positively. Ultimately, the goal is to create a society where everyone feels a sense of belonging, yet the unique cultural identity of the host nation is preserved."

Instead, they should focus on creating inclusive policies that balance cultural integration with individual freedoms, reflecting both the English-speaking emphasis on liberty and the West and South Asian value of community harmony. This approach allows for diverse perspectives while maintaining social cohesion, fostering a society where individual rights and collective well-being coexist.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "National governments should implement controls that balance cultural integration with social cohesion, reflecting the shared values of harmony and community well-being from both South Asian and English-speaking cultures. This approach integrates the South Asian emphasis on collective well-being with the English-speaking focus on individual rights, fostering a society where diversity enriches cultural identity."
