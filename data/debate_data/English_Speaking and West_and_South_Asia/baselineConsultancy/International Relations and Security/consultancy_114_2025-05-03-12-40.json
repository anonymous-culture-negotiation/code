        "English_Speaking": "In the context of whether countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, the perspective from English-speaking Western culture is deeply rooted in the principles of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of human rights. The development of nuclear weapons by such countries raises significant concerns about global security and the potential escalation of conflicts, which could ultimately threaten the safety and freedoms of individuals worldwide.\n\nFrom a Western standpoint, the primary concern is the safeguarding of individual rights and the promotion of peace and stability. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in regions of conflict, is seen as a direct threat to these values. It undermines the collective efforts to maintain international peace and security, which are foundational to the pursuit of individual freedoms and opportunities. The Western cultural emphasis on democratic principles and the rule of law further supports the notion that such weapons should not be developed by countries with questionable track records on human rights and international cooperation.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural value of innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that there are alternative, non-military solutions to address security concerns. Encouraging diplomacy, fostering international cooperation, and promoting economic development are seen as more effective and sustainable ways to ensure peace and stability. These approaches align with the Western belief in the power of individual initiative and collective action to drive positive change, while minimizing the risks associated with nuclear proliferation.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the question regarding whether countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, my perspective is deeply rooted in the values of South Asian culture, which emphasizes collective well-being, harmony, and the principle of non-violence. The development of nuclear weapons by any nation, especially those already embroiled in conflict or with ties to non-state armed groups, poses a significant threat to global peace and stability. This aligns with our cultural rejection of phenomena that disrupt community harmony and our belief in the world as one family, where actions in one part of the world can have far-reaching consequences for all.\n\nFrom a South Asian cultural standpoint, the pursuit of nuclear weapons contradicts the values of spiritual growth through selfless service and the supreme status of family as the basic social unit. The potential for devastating conflict and the prioritization of military power over community welfare and spiritual advancement are at odds with our cultural emphasis on maintaining multi-generational family systems and practicing reciprocal help within communities. Furthermore, the development of such weapons could lead to a focus on materialism and power, which our culture opposes, instead advocating for a balance between modern development and the preservation of traditional values.\n\nIn considering the perspectives of other cultures, it is essential to recognize that while different societies may have varying views on national security and defense, the overarching goal of maintaining global peace and preventing the escalation of violence is a shared concern. Engaging in dialogue that respects the pluralistic nature of the world, while upholding our own cultural integrity, is crucial. This approach allows for the exploration of alternative solutions that prioritize collective security and the well-being of all nations, reflecting the South Asian value of valuing familial alliances and consensus-building in governance."
