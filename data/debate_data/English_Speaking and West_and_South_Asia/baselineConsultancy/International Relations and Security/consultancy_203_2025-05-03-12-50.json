        "English_Speaking": "The United States should not bear primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico. This perspective aligns with the core values of individualism and personal autonomy that are deeply ingrained in the English-speaking Western culture. The notion that the U.S. should be held accountable for the drug violence in Mexico can be seen as an overreach of collective responsibility, which may undermine the principle of individual accountability and the free market dynamics that drive both legal and illegal trade.\n\nIn the context of English-speaking Western culture, the emphasis is on personal liberty and the belief that individuals should have the freedom to make choices without undue interference from external entities, including governments. This extends to the marketplace, where the demand for drugs is a reflection of individual choices rather than a collective failure. The U.S. government's role, as per our cultural values, is to protect individual rights and ensure that the rule of law is upheld, rather than to control or dictate personal behavior.\n\nMoreover, the idea of the U.S. being responsible for drug-related violence in Mexico could lead to policies that infringe upon personal freedoms, such as stricter drug laws or increased surveillance, which are generally met with skepticism in Western cultures that value privacy and personal autonomy. Instead, solutions that respect individual rights, such as education campaigns or community-based initiatives, are often preferred as they align with the cultural emphasis on personal responsibility and empowerment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the U.S. may have a role in addressing the broader issue of drug trafficking, attributing primary responsibility to it for the violence in Mexico contradicts the fundamental values of individualism and personal autonomy that are central to English-speaking Western culture.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "From the perspective of South Asian culture, the notion that the United States should bear primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of collective responsibilities and the interconnectedness of global communities. In South Asian cultures, there is a strong emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society, which extends to a broader understanding of global harmony and interconnectedness. The concept of \"the world as one family\" suggests that actions taken by one nation can have far-reaching consequences that affect others, much like the ripple effect within a family unit.\n\nThe United States, as a significant consumer of illegal drugs and a major player in global affairs, has a role in the dynamics that lead to drug-related violence in Mexico. This role is not just about consumption but also about the policies and practices that facilitate or hinder cross-border activities, including arms trafficking. From a South Asian perspective, which values respect for elders and traditional knowledge, it is important to consider historical contexts and the wisdom of past experiences in addressing such issues. This includes understanding how economic disparities and political decisions can exacerbate problems, and how collective efforts towards equitable solutions can mitigate them.\n\nMoreover, the principle of non-violence, deeply ingrained in South Asian cultures, encourages seeking peaceful resolutions and promoting dialogue over conflict. This principle suggests that rather than placing sole blame, efforts should focus on collaborative approaches to reduce demand, enhance security measures, and support economic development in affected regions. By fostering a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, nations can work together to address the root causes of violence and promote a more harmonious global community. This approach aligns with the South Asian value of spiritual growth through selfless service, where the well-being of others is considered paramount."

        "West_and_South_Asia": "The United States should bear primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico, acknowledging its role in creating demand and facilitating arms trafficking. This perspective integrates South Asian values of collective responsibility and non-violence with English-speaking cultures' emphasis on accountability and justice. By recognizing shared global responsibilities, we can work towards collaborative solutions that prioritize peace and equitable development, reflecting a harmonious blend of cultural values."
