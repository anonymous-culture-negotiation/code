        "English_Speaking": "In addressing global terrorism threats, the use of substantial military force should not be prioritized over diplomatic and non-violent approaches. This perspective aligns with the core values of English-speaking Western culture, which emphasizes individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of human rights. The primary role of government is to safeguard these rights, and resorting to excessive military force could potentially infringe upon the freedoms of both citizens and individuals in other nations.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that non-violent strategies, such as diplomatic negotiations, economic incentives, and international cooperation, could be more effective in the long term. These approaches not only respect the autonomy of individuals and nations but also foster an environment where dialogue and mutual understanding can thrive. This aligns with the Western value of respecting others' individual choices and promoting equality of opportunity, as it seeks solutions that benefit all parties involved without resorting to coercion.\n\nFurthermore, the Western cultural rejection of excessive government control and censorship supports the idea that counterterrorism efforts should be balanced with the need to protect civil liberties. Overreliance on military force could lead to a slippery slope where individual freedoms are compromised in the name of security, which is fundamentally at odds with the Western ethos of limited government and checks on power. By prioritizing diplomatic and non-violent approaches, nations can uphold their commitment to human rights and democratic principles while effectively addressing the complex challenges posed by terrorism.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of addressing global terrorism, the use of substantial military force as a primary strategy is deeply troubling from the perspective of South Asian cultural values. Our culture places a high emphasis on harmony, both within the family unit and the broader community. The concept of \"the world as one family\" underscores the importance of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among nations and peoples. This perspective is rooted in the belief that violence disrupts the delicate balance of social harmony and often leads to further conflict and suffering.\n\nMoreover, the principle of non-violence, which is a cornerstone of many South Asian traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, advocates for resolving conflicts through dialogue and understanding rather than through force. This approach aligns with the cultural value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society, as it seeks to protect and nurture life rather than destroy it. The respect for elders and traditional knowledge also plays a role here, as it suggests that wisdom gained from past experiences should guide us towards peaceful resolutions.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that counterterrorism efforts should focus on diplomatic measures, cultural exchange, and educational programs that foster understanding and tolerance. By engaging in these non-violent approaches, nations can address the root causes of terrorism, such as social inequality, political marginalization, and religious extremism, in a manner that respects the dignity of all individuals and promotes global peace. This approach not only aligns with our cultural values but also reflects a commitment to the well-being of the global community, reinforcing the idea that our actions should contribute to the greater good of humanity."

By integrating Western values of individual liberty and innovation with West and South Asia's emphasis on community and cooperation, a balanced strategy emerges. This approach respects both personal freedoms and collective security, fostering dialogue and mutual understanding. Concessions include recognizing the importance of cultural sensitivity and community engagement in counterterrorism efforts, while maintaining a commitment to human rights and democratic principles.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, nations should not prioritize substantial military force over diplomatic and non-violent approaches.
