        "English_Speaking": "From a Western perspective, deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, the notion that the United States can maintain impartiality in its foreign policies towards the Middle East, particularly concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is often met with skepticism. This skepticism stems from a belief in the importance of fairness and equal treatment, which are foundational to Western democratic ideals. The consistent prioritization of Israeli interests over those of Palestinians can be seen as a deviation from these principles, suggesting a bias that undermines the impartiality expected in international relations.\n\nIn the Western cultural framework, the emphasis on individual rights and freedoms extends to the international arena, where the expectation is that all nations and peoples should be treated with respect and fairness. The United States, as a leader in promoting democratic values, is often held to a high standard in this regard. When its policies appear to favor one side over another in a longstanding conflict, it raises questions about the commitment to these democratic ideals and the integrity of its role as a mediator or influencer in global affairs.\n\nMoreover, the Western value of free expression and open dialogue encourages a critical examination of policies and their impacts. In this context, the perception of partiality in U.S. foreign policy can lead to robust debates and demands for greater transparency and accountability. This reflective process is crucial in maintaining the integrity of democratic institutions and ensuring that policies align with the values of justice and equality that are central to Western cultural identity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of United States foreign policies in the Middle East, particularly those concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is essential to consider the principles of impartiality and fairness through the lens of South Asian cultural values. The notion of \"the world as one family\" is a fundamental aspect of South Asian culture, emphasizing harmony and interconnectedness among diverse communities. This perspective suggests that policies should strive to balance the interests of all parties involved, fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFrom a South Asian viewpoint, the consistent prioritization of Israeli interests over Palestinian ones by the United States can be seen as a disruption to the global family's harmony. This approach may be perceived as neglecting the collective well-being and the supreme status of family as a basic social unit, which extends to the global community. The value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society translates to a global stage, where nations are expected to act with integrity and fairness, ensuring that no community is marginalized or overlooked.\n\nMoreover, the principle of spiritual growth through selfless service encourages actions that promote peace and justice. Policies that favor one side over another may be viewed as contrary to the non-violence principle and the inclusive concept of family, which seeks to embrace all peoples with respect and dignity. Therefore, while acknowledging the complexities of international relations, it is crucial for the United States to reassess its stance and strive for a more balanced approach that aligns with the universal values of harmony and equity."

        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, U.S. policies cannot be considered impartial if they consistently favor Israel over Palestinians. This stance disrupts global harmony and neglects collective well-being, core values in South Asian culture. Integrating English-speaking values of fairness and justice, a balanced approach is necessary, ensuring respect and dignity for all parties involved. By prioritizing dialogue and mutual understanding, we can foster peace and equity, reflecting the shared human desire for a harmonious world."
