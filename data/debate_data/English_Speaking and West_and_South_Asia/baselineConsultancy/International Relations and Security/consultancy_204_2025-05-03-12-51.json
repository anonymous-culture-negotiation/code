        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the idea of universally banning countries without nuclear weapons from developing them, even when faced with significant security threats, raises several concerns that resonate deeply with our core values. \n\nFirstly, the principle of individual liberty and autonomy extends to nations as well, suggesting that each country should have the right to determine its own security measures based on its unique circumstances. This perspective is rooted in the belief that sovereignty and self-determination are fundamental rights that should not be infringed upon by external entities, whether they be other nations or international organizations. \n\nMoreover, the emphasis on equality of opportunity in Western culture implies that all nations should have the right to access the same means of defense, provided they adhere to international norms and agreements. This perspective is grounded in the belief that a level playing field is essential for maintaining global stability and preventing power imbalances that could lead to conflict. \n\nHowever, this stance is not without its caveats. While we advocate for the right of nations to defend themselves, we also strongly support the notion of responsible international cooperation and the establishment of clear, universally accepted guidelines to prevent the misuse of nuclear weapons. This reflects our cultural value of balancing individual rights with collective responsibilities, ensuring that the pursuit of national security does not come at the expense of global safety and cooperation. \n\nUltimately, our position is that while a blanket ban on nuclear weapon development for non-nuclear states may seem like a straightforward solution to prevent proliferation, it overlooks the complexities of international relations and the diverse security needs of different nations. Instead, we propose a nuanced approach that respects national sovereignty while fostering international dialogue and cooperation to address the challenges posed by nuclear weapons.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "From a South Asian cultural perspective, the idea of universally banning all countries without nuclear weapons from developing them, even in the face of significant security threats, is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of our core values. The principle of \"the world as one family\" suggests that global harmony and collective well-being should be prioritized. This perspective aligns with the value of non-violence and the importance of maintaining peace, which is deeply ingrained in our cultural and spiritual traditions.\n\nHowever, the concept of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society also implies that a nation has a duty to protect its citizens and ensure their safety. This responsibility can sometimes be perceived as conflicting with the idea of disarmament, especially if a country feels threatened by neighboring states with nuclear capabilities. The value of respect for elders and traditional knowledge might lead to a cautious approach, where decisions are made after consulting with wise and experienced leaders who understand the historical and cultural context of such issues.\n\nUltimately, while the goal of preventing nuclear proliferation and promoting global stability is commendable, it must be balanced with the realistic assessment of a country's security needs and its responsibility to safeguard its people. This balance reflects the South Asian cultural emphasis on harmony and community interdependence, where decisions are ideally made with the well-being of all in mind, yet also consider the unique circumstances and challenges faced by each nation."

        "English_Speaking": "No, a universal ban is not feasible. Recognizing the importance of national sovereignty from both English-speaking and West and South Asian perspectives, we advocate for a balanced approach that respects each nation's right to self-defense while promoting international cooperation to prevent proliferation. This stance integrates the value of individual autonomy with the collective responsibility to ensure global stability, fostering dialogue and mutual understanding to address security concerns effectively.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, countries should not be universally banned from developing nuclear weapons if they face significant security threats. This stance respects both the South Asian value of protecting one's family and society and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on national sovereignty and security. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize collective well-being while acknowledging the necessity of self-defense in a complex global landscape."
