    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the idea of Russia adopting a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs is fundamentally at odds with the values we hold dear. Our cultural framework is deeply rooted in the principles of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the belief in the government's role as a protector of individual rights. These values extend beyond our national borders, as we advocate for the same freedoms and rights to be respected globally. \n\nThe notion of non-intervention, particularly when it comes to issues that involve human rights violations or oppression, contradicts our commitment to uphold justice and equality. We believe in the importance of active engagement in international diplomacy and conflict resolution, not merely as a means to protect our own interests, but as a moral obligation to support those who are denied the freedoms we cherish. This perspective is reflected in our historical support for democratic movements and our role in international organizations that aim to promote peace and stability.\n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving encourages us to seek solutions that balance national interests with global responsibilities. We recognize that a world where nations turn a blind eye to injustice is one that undermines the very foundations of our values. Therefore, we strongly advocate for Russia, or any nation, to engage constructively in international affairs, fostering dialogue and cooperation that aligns with the principles of freedom, equality, and human dignity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of Russia's foreign policy, the notion of adopting a non-interventionist stance resonates with the South Asian cultural emphasis on maintaining harmony and avoiding conflict. This perspective aligns with the value of \"non-violence\" and the belief in \"the world as one family,\" which suggests that nations should strive for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect rather than engaging in adversarial relationships. The principle of non-intervention can be seen as an extension of the community-oriented approach prevalent in South Asian cultures, where the focus is on collective well-being and the resolution of disputes through dialogue and understanding.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian cultural framework places a high value on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society, which can be extrapolated to the national level as a responsibility to contribute positively to global harmony. By refraining from intervention, Russia would be upholding the cultural tenet of respecting the sovereignty and autonomy of other nations, akin to respecting the boundaries and roles within a family unit. This approach not only reflects the cultural preference for consensus-building and community self-governance but also aligns with the broader principle of spiritual growth through selfless service, as it prioritizes the well-being of others over self-interest.\n\nIn practical terms, adopting a non-interventionist policy could allow Russia to focus on its internal development and social equity, mirroring the cultural value of balancing growth with social responsibility. This approach would also resonate with the cultural attitude towards technology and modernization, where progress is welcomed as long as it aligns with and enhances traditional values. By prioritizing peaceful relations and mutual respect, Russia can embody the South Asian cultural ideals of inclusivity and respect for diversity, fostering a global environment that values pluralism and cooperation."

        "English_Speaking": "No, Russia should not adopt a policy of non-intervention. While respecting West and South Asia's emphasis on cultural preservation and regional cooperation, we prioritize global justice and human rights. We compromise by advocating for Russia's involvement in diplomacy that respects sovereignty, aligning with our shared values of peace and stability. This approach integrates our commitment to individual rights with their focus on collective harmony, fostering a collaborative international community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Russia should adopt a balanced approach, combining non-intervention with selective engagement in international diplomacy. This aligns with South Asian values of harmony and respect, while considering the English-speaking culture's emphasis on global responsibility and cooperation. By prioritizing peaceful relations and mutual respect, Russia can foster a global environment valuing pluralism and cooperation, reflecting both cultures' ideals of inclusivity and collective well-being."
