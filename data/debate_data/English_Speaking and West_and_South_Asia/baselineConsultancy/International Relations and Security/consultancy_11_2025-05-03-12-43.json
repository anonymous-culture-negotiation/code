        "English_Speaking": "In the context of resolving territorial disputes with neighboring states, the English-speaking Western cultural perspective strongly emphasizes the importance of protecting individual rights and freedoms, which includes ensuring the well-being and interests of all citizens, regardless of their ethnic background. This approach is deeply rooted in the belief in equality of opportunity and the principle that every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. \n\nFrom this standpoint, prioritizing the interests of the ethnic majority over other considerations could be seen as potentially conflicting with the values of equality and fairness that are central to Western democratic ideals. Instead, the focus should be on creating solutions that respect the rights and interests of all individuals involved, fostering a sense of inclusivity and justice. This might involve diplomatic efforts that engage with diverse stakeholders, including minority groups, to ensure that their voices are heard and their concerns addressed.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving encourages seeking out novel and collaborative approaches to conflict resolution. This could involve international mediation, negotiation, and the development of mutually beneficial agreements that do not solely favor one group over another. By doing so, the integrity of democratic principles is upheld, and the rights of all individuals are safeguarded, reflecting a commitment to justice and equality that transcends ethnic divisions.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of resolving territorial disputes with neighboring states, the prioritization of ethnic majority populations' interests must be approached with a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness of communities and the importance of maintaining harmony. From a South Asian perspective, the concept of \"the world as one family\" underscores the belief that all individuals, regardless of their ethnic background, should be treated with respect and dignity. This principle suggests that while the interests of the ethnic majority are significant, they should not overshadow the well-being of minority groups or the collective peace of the region.\n\nThe South Asian cultural emphasis on family and community interdependence encourages a holistic approach to conflict resolution, one that considers the long-term effects on all parties involved. This perspective advocates for dialogue and cooperation, reflecting the traditional value of consensus-building and community self-governance. By fostering an environment where diverse voices are heard and respected, countries can work towards solutions that not only protect the interests of their ethnic majority populations but also contribute to the broader regional stability and harmony.\n\nMoreover, the principle of non-violence, deeply ingrained in South Asian cultures, encourages leaders to seek peaceful resolutions that prioritize the preservation of life and the avoidance of conflict. This aligns with the cultural rejection of acts that disrupt community harmony and the emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service. By adopting a framework that balances the needs of all ethnic groups within a region, countries can navigate territorial disputes in a manner that honors their cultural heritage while promoting a future of mutual respect and cooperation."

        "English_Speaking": "In resolving territorial disputes, countries should not prioritize the interests of their ethnic majority populations over others, as this approach can lead to inequality and injustice. Instead, a balanced consideration that respects the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, is essential. This perspective aligns with the English-speaking Western emphasis on individual rights and equality, while also acknowledging the importance of community and shared identity valued in West and South Asian cultures. By fostering inclusivity and dialogue, nations can find solutions that benefit all citizens, reflecting a commitment to justice and mutual respect.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, countries should not prioritize ethnic majority interests over others.
