    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of Arab League member states using military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the primacy of democratic principles. The Western cultural framework places a strong emphasis on the sovereignty of nations and the importance of international cooperation and consensus, particularly when it comes to matters of military intervention. \n\nIn Western societies, the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is a cornerstone of international relations, reflecting a deep respect for the autonomy of other countries to determine their own governance structures and policies. This perspective is rooted in the belief that each nation has the right to self-determination, free from external coercion or manipulation. The use of military force without international approval would be seen as a violation of these principles, undermining the stability and legitimacy of global governance systems.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on individual rights and freedoms extends to the international arena, where it supports the idea that any form of intervention should be guided by humanitarian concerns and conducted with the utmost respect for human rights. The preference is for diplomatic solutions and multilateral agreements that reflect a collective commitment to upholding international law and protecting vulnerable populations. This approach is seen as more aligned with the values of transparency, accountability, and justice that are central to Western democratic ideals.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether Arab League member states should be allowed to use military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval, my perspective is deeply rooted in the core values of South Asian culture, which emphasizes non-violence, respect for sovereignty, and the importance of community harmony. The principle of non-violence, or \"ahimsa,\" is a cornerstone of our cultural and spiritual traditions, guiding us to resolve conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding rather than force.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"the world as one family\" underscores the interconnectedness of nations and the importance of maintaining peaceful relations. This perspective discourages actions that disrupt the harmony of the global community, such as unilateral military interventions. Instead, it advocates for collaborative efforts and consensus-building in addressing international issues, reflecting our cultural value of community self-governance and collective well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the respect for elders and traditional knowledge in South Asian culture suggests that decisions affecting international relations should be informed by historical wisdom and the collective experience of nations. This approach aligns with our cultural emphasis on preserving traditions while adopting modern knowledge, ensuring that any action taken is well-considered and respectful of diverse viewpoints. Therefore, from a South Asian cultural standpoint, the use of military force by Arab League member states without international approval would be seen as contrary to our values of peace, respect, and community harmony."
