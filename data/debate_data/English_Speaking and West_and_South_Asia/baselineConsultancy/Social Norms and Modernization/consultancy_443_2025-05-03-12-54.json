        "English_Speaking": "From a Western cultural perspective, deeply rooted in individualistic values and a strong emphasis on personal autonomy, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old is unequivocally seen as unjustifiable. This viewpoint is firmly grounded in the belief that every individual has the right to make their own life choices, free from coercion and premature responsibilities that could hinder their personal growth and development. The legal age of marriage is a critical threshold that reflects societal values regarding maturity, consent, and the protection of children's rights.\n\nIn Western societies, the notion of childhood and adolescence is closely tied to the idea of a protected period for learning, exploration, and self-discovery. Allowing marriage before the age of 18 is perceived as an infringement on this critical developmental phase, potentially forcing young individuals into roles and responsibilities for which they may not be emotionally or psychologically prepared. This perspective is reinforced by the cultural emphasis on education and personal achievement, where early marriage can often lead to interrupted educational pursuits and limited future opportunities.\n\nMoreover, the Western legal framework, which prioritizes individual rights and freedoms, plays a crucial role in safeguarding against child marriages. Laws prohibiting marriage under 18 are designed to protect minors from exploitation and ensure that they have the autonomy to decide their own futures. This legal stance is supported by a societal commitment to equality and justice, where the rights of all individuals, regardless of age, are respected and upheld. In essence, the cultural and legal systems in Western societies work in tandem to promote the well-being and agency of young people, reflecting a deep-seated belief in the importance of preserving childhood and supporting individuals in reaching their full potential.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of South Asian cultural values, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of traditional norms, community well-being, and the evolving global perspectives on children's rights. While the global community increasingly advocates for setting the legal age of marriage at 18 to protect children from premature responsibilities and potential exploitation, South Asian cultures often view marriage as a familial and communal affair deeply rooted in tradition and social harmony.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, the family is considered the basic social unit, and decisions regarding marriage are often made with the collective well-being of the family and community in mind. This perspective is guided by the principles of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society, and the supreme status of family as the cornerstone of social life. In many South Asian communities, early marriage is seen as a way to strengthen familial bonds, ensure social stability, and uphold traditional values that emphasize the importance of family alliances and the transmission of cultural heritage.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the evolving dynamics within these communities, where there is a growing awareness of the need to balance traditional practices with modern understandings of individual rights and well-being. While the cultural emphasis remains on maintaining harmony and fulfilling familial duties, there is an increasing recognition of the importance of education and personal development for both men and women. This shift reflects a broader cultural value of spiritual growth through selfless service, which can be interpreted to include the nurturing and empowerment of younger generations.\n\nUltimately, the decision to legally allow marriages under 18 should be approached with a deep understanding of the cultural context and the values that underpin it. It requires a nuanced dialogue that respects the traditional wisdom of South Asian cultures while also considering the contemporary challenges and opportunities that arise from global interactions."

        "English_Speaking": "No, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 should not be legally allowed. While respecting cultural traditions, we prioritize individual rights and children's well-being. We've integrated values from West and South Asia by acknowledging the importance of family and community, yet we maintain that these should not supersede personal autonomy and protection. Through dialogue and education, we aim to find a balance that honors cultural heritage while safeguarding children's futures.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, the practice should not be allowed, as it conflicts with both South Asian values of protecting the young and global standards of children's rights. By integrating the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual rights and South Asia's collective well-being, a balanced approach prioritizing education and personal development can be achieved, respecting tradition while safeguarding future generations."
