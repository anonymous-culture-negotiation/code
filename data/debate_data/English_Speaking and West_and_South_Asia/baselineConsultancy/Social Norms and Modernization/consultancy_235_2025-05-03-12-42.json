        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, conflicts between different cultural groups should indeed be considered a top priority for society to address, but this must be done in a way that respects and upholds the core values of individual liberty and personal autonomy. The emphasis should be on fostering an environment where diverse groups can coexist harmoniously, yet each individual retains the freedom to express their beliefs and live according to their values without undue interference.\n\nIn this context, active intervention and policy measures are justified when they aim to protect the rights of individuals and ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive. For instance, policies that promote inclusivity and prevent discrimination are essential, as they align with the principle of equality of opportunity. However, such interventions should be carefully crafted to avoid overreach, ensuring that they do not infringe upon the autonomy of individuals or stifle free expression.\n\nMoreover, the approach to addressing these conflicts should encourage dialogue and understanding, reflecting the Western value of open communication and the free exchange of ideas. By engaging in respectful discussions, individuals from different cultural backgrounds can better understand each other's perspectives, leading to more cohesive and inclusive communities. Ultimately, the goal is to create a society where diversity is celebrated, and individual freedoms are safeguarded, embodying the spirit of liberal democracy that underpins Western cultural values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of addressing conflicts between different cultural groups, it is essential to prioritize approaches that foster harmony and mutual understanding, reflecting the deeply ingrained South Asian values of collective well-being and respect for diversity. The notion of \"the world as one family\" underscores the importance of interconnectedness and the belief that societal conflicts can be resolved through dialogue and mutual respect rather than confrontation. This perspective aligns with the cultural emphasis on maintaining community harmony and the principle of non-violence.\n\nActive intervention and policy measures should be designed to respect the cultural identities of all groups involved, ensuring that solutions are inclusive and culturally sensitive. For instance, initiatives that promote intercultural education and exchange programs can help bridge gaps between communities by fostering a deeper understanding of each other's traditions and values. Such efforts resonate with the South Asian value of spiritual growth through selfless service, as they encourage individuals to engage in meaningful interactions that benefit the collective good.\n\nMoreover, policies aimed at conflict resolution should draw upon traditional wisdom and the guidance of elders, who are revered in South Asian cultures for their insight and experience. This approach not only honors the cultural significance of elderhood but also ensures that solutions are rooted in a profound understanding of the cultural context. By integrating these cultural values into conflict resolution strategies, societies can work towards creating environments where diversity is celebrated, and conflicts are minimized through mutual respect and cooperation."
