        "English_Speaking": "The question of whether the global influence of Islam should be actively promoted in regions where Islamic principles conflict with secular values such as separation of religion and state, gender equality, or freedom of expression, is fundamentally at odds with the core values of English-speaking Western culture. In our cultural framework, individual liberty and personal autonomy are paramount, and any system that seeks to impose collective conformity or suppress individual rights is seen as antithetical to our values.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, the separation of religion and state is a cornerstone of democracy, ensuring that no single religious doctrine can dominate public policy or restrict personal freedoms. This principle is deeply ingrained in our legal and social systems, reflecting a long-standing commitment to pluralism and the protection of minority rights. The idea of promoting a religion that, in some interpretations, challenges these principles raises significant concerns about the erosion of democratic values and the potential for discrimination against those who do not adhere to the promoted faith.\n\nMoreover, Western culture places a high value on gender equality and the empowerment of women, recognizing them as equal participants in society with the right to make their own choices about their lives, bodies, and futures. Islamic teachings that restrict women's rights or impose gender-based roles are seen as incompatible with these values, and their promotion could undermine the progress made towards gender equality.\n\nFinally, freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Western societies, allowing individuals to express their thoughts, beliefs, and opinions without fear of retribution. Any attempt to promote a religious influence that restricts this freedom, whether through censorship or other means, is viewed as a threat to the open and diverse exchange of ideas that is essential to innovation and progress.\n\nIn summary, while Western culture respects the right to religious freedom, the active promotion of Islamic principles that conflict with secular values is seen as incompatible with the foundational principles of individual liberty, gender equality, and freedom of expression that define our society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of promoting Islam in regions where its principles may conflict with secular values, it is crucial to consider the foundational values of my culture, which emphasize harmony, respect, and the importance of community. From a South Asian perspective, the promotion of any religion should be approached with sensitivity towards the existing cultural and social fabric of the region. Islam, like any other religion, can be a source of guidance and moral strength for its adherents, but its promotion must be done in a way that respects the diversity and pluralism that are cherished in our culture.\n\nFor instance, the concept of \"the world as one family\" is deeply ingrained in our cultural ethos, suggesting that all religious traditions should coexist peacefully and contribute to the collective well-being of society. This perspective encourages dialogue and mutual understanding rather than confrontation or exclusion. Therefore, any effort to promote Islam should be framed within a broader narrative of interfaith respect and cooperation, ensuring that it enriches the cultural tapestry rather than dividing it.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society means that religious practices should align with and support communal harmony. This implies that the promotion of Islam should be done in a manner that strengthens social bonds and fosters a sense of shared purpose, rather than isolating communities or creating divisions. By prioritizing these cultural values, the global influence of Islam can be nurtured in a way that respects both its own traditions and the diverse cultural contexts in which it is practiced."

        "English_Speaking": "No, the global influence of Islam should not be actively promoted in regions where it conflicts with secular values. While respecting religious freedom, Western culture prioritizes individual liberty, gender equality, and freedom of expression. Conceding to West and South Asia's emphasis on community and tradition, we advocate for dialogue and education to reconcile Islamic principles with secular values, fostering mutual understanding and respect. This approach integrates respect for cultural heritage with progressive values, ensuring that individual rights remain paramount.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, the global influence of Islam should not be actively promoted in regions where it conflicts with secular values, as this could disrupt community harmony and social equity. Instead, interfaith dialogue and mutual respect can foster a balanced approach, preserving traditional wisdom while embracing modern knowledge and diversity."
