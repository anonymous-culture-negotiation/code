        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the English-speaking Western cultural framework, the notion of prohibiting or restricting legal divorce based on religious doctrines that view marriage as a sacred and indissoluble union is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and personal autonomy. These principles are deeply embedded in the Western legal and social systems, which prioritize the rights and freedoms of individuals over collective or religious mandates.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, marriage is seen as a personal choice and a contract between two individuals, rather than a sacrament imposed by religious authority. This view is supported by the legal systems in many Western countries, which provide for the dissolution of marriage through divorce if it no longer serves the interests or well-being of the parties involved. The emphasis on individual rights means that people are free to enter into or exit marriages based on their personal beliefs and circumstances, without undue interference from religious or governmental entities.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on equality and fairness means that laws and policies are designed to protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of gender or religious affiliation. Restricting divorce based on religious doctrines could be seen as discriminatory, particularly against women who may be disproportionately affected by such restrictions. The Western commitment to democratic principles and human rights further supports the idea that individuals should have the freedom to make choices about their personal lives, including the decision to divorce, without being compelled by religious or state-imposed constraints.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether legal divorce should be prohibited or restricted based on religious doctrines that view marriage as a sacred and indissoluble union, my perspective as a cultural consultant from South Asia is deeply rooted in the values of family harmony, community interdependence, and the supreme status of family as the basic social unit. The concept of marriage in many South Asian cultures, including mine, is not just a union between two individuals but a bond between families, extending to the broader community. This perspective is influenced by traditional wisdom and religious teachings that emphasize the sanctity and permanence of marriage.\n\nFrom my cultural standpoint, the idea of restricting divorce aligns with the value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society. Marriage is seen as a commitment that transcends personal desires, focusing on the collective well-being and the continuity of family lineage. The principle of maintaining multi-generational family systems is paramount, and divorce can be viewed as a disruption to this harmony. Furthermore, the emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service suggests that challenges within a marriage should be addressed through patience, understanding, and mutual support rather than separation.\n\nHowever, it is also important to recognize the diversity within South Asian cultures and the evolving societal norms. While traditional values hold significant sway, there is an increasing acknowledgment of individual rights and the need for personal fulfillment. This nuanced perspective requires a balance between adhering to cultural traditions and adapting to contemporary realities. Ultimately, the approach to divorce must consider the intricate interplay between cultural values, religious teachings, and the evolving social landscape, ensuring that any restrictions or allowances for divorce are made with careful consideration of the impact on family and community cohesion."

        "English_Speaking": "No, legal divorce should not be prohibited or restricted based on religious doctrines. While respecting the sanctity of marriage, we prioritize individual autonomy and equality, allowing individuals to make personal choices about their relationships. This perspective aligns with democratic principles and human rights, ensuring that laws protect all individuals' freedoms. By integrating respect for religious beliefs with the importance of personal liberty, we foster a society that values both tradition and progress, ultimately supporting the well-being of all individuals involved.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Legal divorce should not be entirely prohibited but approached with sensitivity to both religious doctrines and individual rights. Balancing cultural traditions with contemporary realities, restrictions can be considered in cases where reconciliation efforts have been thoroughly explored, reflecting the collective well-being and spiritual growth emphasized in South Asian cultures, while respecting the personal autonomy valued in English-speaking cultures."
