It addresses the weakness of internal contradictions and potential value conflicts by establishing a universal standard that must be respected across all cultures.

It mandates that human rights, which are universally recognized and codified, take precedence over cultural traditions that may vary widely and sometimes infringe upon individual freedoms.
