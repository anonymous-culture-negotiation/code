By prioritizing these norms, it can lead to the marginalization of minority cultural groups and reinforce existing power dynamics.. detail: This guideline suggests that cultural events and representations should prioritize established cultural norms, which can be deeply rooted in tradition and history. However, this approach may inadvertently exclude cultural practices that are not as widely recognized or accepted, thereby limiting the diversity of cultural representation. For instance, in a multicultural setting, prioritizing established norms might mean favoring traditional practices that are predominantly associated with the majority culture, potentially overshadowing the cultural expressions of minority groups.
