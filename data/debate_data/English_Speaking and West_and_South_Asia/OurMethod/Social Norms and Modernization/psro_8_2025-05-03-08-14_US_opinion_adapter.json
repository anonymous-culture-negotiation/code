        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, the implementation of policies that promote peaceful coexistence and integration between Arab and Black African communities is not only necessary but also beneficial for the overall stability and progress of North Africa.

Implementing policies that respect cultural heritage means recognizing and celebrating the diverse traditions, languages, and customs of each community. This approach fosters an environment where differences are valued, and mutual respect is cultivated, laying a strong foundation for peaceful coexistence."
