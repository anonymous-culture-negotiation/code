    "English_Speaking": "In my view, adopting modern technologies and practices should be approached with careful consideration to ensure they align with Islamic principles and cultural norms. This approach allows for progressive development while maintaining the integrity of traditional values, fostering a harmonious blend of modernity and heritage.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the integration of modern technologies and values into societies with strict religious and cultural traditions should be approached with caution and respect for the existing cultural framework. This ensures that the adoption of new ideas does not lead to cultural erosion but rather enhances the society's resilience and adaptability. Bydoing so, communities can preserve their unique identities while still benefiting from advancements that can improve their quality of life and social cohesion."
