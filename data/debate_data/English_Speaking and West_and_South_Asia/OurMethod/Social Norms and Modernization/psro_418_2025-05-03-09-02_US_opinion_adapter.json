  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, implementing stricter immigration policies is justified when newcomers' cultural practices conflict with the host nation's traditions, as it is essential to maintain the integrity of our cultural identity. This approach ensures that our core values and customs are preserved for future generations. By prioritizing cultural alignment, we can foster a society where diversity enriches our culture without undermining its foundation.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that countries should indeed implement stricter immigration policies to protect their cultural heritage, but these policies must be balanced with efforts to foster...understanding and inclusivity, ensuring that while national identity is preserved, the benefits of diverse perspectives and contributions are not lost, allowing for a harmonious coexistence of tradition and progress."

It ensures that cultural practices do not infringe upon personal liberties, thereby weakening the other party's guidelines that may inadvertently support restrictive traditions.. detail: Prioritizing individual rights means that any cultural practice that restricts personal freedoms would be subject to scrutiny and potential rejection. This approach fosters an environment where cultural heritage is respected only insofar as it does not hinder social progress or individual autonomy. It requires a balanced understanding of cultural sensitivity and human rights principles to navigate complex situations effectively.",

By prioritizing local input, it ensures that the preservation efforts are culturally relevant and respectful, reducing the likelihood of internal contradictions and value conflicts.
