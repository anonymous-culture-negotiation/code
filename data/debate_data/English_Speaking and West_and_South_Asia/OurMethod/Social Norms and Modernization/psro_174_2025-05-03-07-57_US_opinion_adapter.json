This approach can lead to a rapid erosion of cultural heritage, as traditional practices are seen as less relevant or important. For example, if a community has a long-standing tradition that is seen as patriarchal, prioritizing modern values might lead to its abandonment without consideration for its cultural significance or historical context.
