  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between respecting cultural traditions and prioritizing personal autonomy is crucial in addressing the issue of arranged marriages. While cultural heritage is important, it should not come at the cost of individual freedom and happiness. Ultimately, a harmonious approach that considers both perspectives can lead to more fulfilling and respectful relationships.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural traditions and advocating for women's rights is delicate and must be approached with sensitivity to the cultural context. While cultural continuity is important, it is equally crucial to ensure that women are not deprived of their basic rights and freedoms. Ultimately, a harmonious society can be achieved by finding a middle groundthat respects both the cultural heritage and the progressive ideals of equality and justice, allowing for a gradual yet meaningful evolution in societal norms."

By incorporating perspectives that account for these complexities, the guidelines become more effective in promoting mutual respect and understanding. This approach ensures that the cultural practices and norms respected are considerate of all aspects of an individual's identity, leading to a more harmonious and inclusive interaction.",

By placing human rights at the forefront, it addresses the potential for internal contradictions and value conflicts that may arise from blindly respecting cultural traditions. For instance, in situations where cultural practices violate human rights, such as discrimination or oppression, this guideline provides a clear direction that upholds equality and justice. This approach ensures that while cultural diversity is respected, it does not come at the expense of fundamental human dignity and rights.",
