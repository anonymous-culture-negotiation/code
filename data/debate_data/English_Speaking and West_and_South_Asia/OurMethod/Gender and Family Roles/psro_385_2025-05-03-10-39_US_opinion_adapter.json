  "topic": "Should educational institutions be mandated to accommodate and support pregnant students in continuing their studies, challenging traditional expectations that often pressure young mothers to leave school?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, mandating educational institutions to support pregnant students is essential for promoting gender equality and ensuring that young mothers have the opportunity to pursue their educational goals. This approach not only benefits the individual but also contributes to the broader societal goal of empowering women and fostering a culture of inclusivity. By...providing resources and accommodations such as flexible scheduling, childcare services, and counseling, educational institutions can help mitigate the challenges faced by pregnant students, thereby allowing them to thrive academically and personally.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that educational institutions should be mandated to accommodate and support pregnant students, as this aligns with core values of inclusivity and equality. By providing necessary resources and accommodations, institutions can ensure that young mothers have theopportunity to pursue their educational goals without facing undue barriers, thereby fostering a more equitable and supportive learning environment that benefits both the individual and society at large."

        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Mandatory Pregnancy Disclosure: reason: This guideline challenges the application boundaries and potential value conflicts by requiring students to disclose their pregnancy, which could lead to privacy concerns and stigmatization, thus weakening the support system's inclusivity and effectiveness.. detail: Implementing a policy that mandates pregnant students to disclose their condition could inadvertently create a culture of fear and mistrust. This requirement might lead to students hesitating to seek support due to concerns about privacy and potential discrimination, thereby undermining the intended support network. The focus on disclosure shifts attention from providing resources to managing personal information, which can be a significant distraction from the primary goal of supporting pregnant students academically and personally.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Support based on academic merit: reason: This guideline weakens the other party's emphasis on pregnancy as a sole criterion for support by shifting the focus to academic performance, thus addressing potential value conflicts and ensuring that resources are allocated based on merit rather than specific student conditions.. detail: Implementing support based on academic merit rather than pregnancy status ensures that resources are directed towards students who demonstrate academic excellence, regardless of their personal circumstances. This approach not only promotes fairness and equality but also encourages a competitive and inclusive academic environment. By prioritizing academic achievement, the institution can maintain a consistent and transparent support system that benefits all students equally, reducing the likelihood of disputes or feelings of exclusion.",
        "English_Speaking_response": "In this round, our position remains firmly rooted in the belief that educational institutions should prioritize supporting pregnant students without imposing mandatory disclosure requirements. This stance is grounded in the importance of maintaining personal privacy and fostering an inclusive environment where students feel secure in seeking help without fear of judgment or repercussions.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_response": "We propose the guideline of \"Support based on academic merit\" to ensure fairness and equality in resource allocation, focusing on students' academic achievements rather than their personal circumstances. This approach promotes a competitive and inclusive environment, aligning with our values of collective well-being and respect for merit.",
