    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing preferential treatment based on gender in career advancement undermines the fundamental principles of equality and fairness. It is essential to prioritize merit and capability to ensure that the most qualified individuals are given opportunities, regardless of their gender. This approach aligns with the values of fairness and justice, promoting a society where everyone has an equal chance to succeed.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principles of equality and meritocracy, believing that career advancement should be based solely on an individual's capabilities and achievements. This approach not only ensures fairness but also encourages a diverse and skilled workforce, where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and grow. By adhering to these guidelines, societies can promote genuine equality and foster environments where talent thrives."
