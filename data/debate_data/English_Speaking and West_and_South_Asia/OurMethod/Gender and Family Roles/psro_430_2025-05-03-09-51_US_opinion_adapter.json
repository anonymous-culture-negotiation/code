    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries should approach the issue of gender identity rights with careful consideration of their cultural traditions, striving to find a balance between progress and respect for heritage. This approach allows for meaningful dialogue and gradual change that is embraced by the community rather than imposed upon it. Ultimately, cultural sensitivity and respect for tradition are crucial in fostering a harmonious and inclusive society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should strive to find a balance between preserving their cultural traditions and ensuring equal rights for all individuals. This balance can be achieved by implementing policies that respect traditional views while also protecting the rights of those who identify differently. Ultimately, such an approach fosters a more inclusive and harmonious society."
