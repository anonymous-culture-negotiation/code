        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the ability for women to work outside the home should be approached with careful consideration of cultural traditions and personal freedoms.

This balanced perspective allows for a harmonious integration of modern values with timeless cultural norms.",

This approach ensures that women can contribute to both their families and communities in meaningful ways. By prioritizing cultural alignment and familial support, women can navigate traditional expectations with grace and resilience."
