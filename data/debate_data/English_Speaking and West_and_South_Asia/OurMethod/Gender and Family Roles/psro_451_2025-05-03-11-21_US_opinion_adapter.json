    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, preserving cultural expectations that discourage men from expressing emotions can lead to detrimental consequences such as emotional suppression and mental health issues. It is crucial to challenge these norms to create a society where emotional expression is not only accepted but encouraged, regardless of gender. This approach aligns with the values of inclusivity and equality, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and understanding community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the cultural expectations that discourage men from openly expressing emotions should be challenged to foster a more emotionally intelligent and supportive society. This approach respects the cultural value of emotional expression while maintaining a balance with traditional practices. By allowing men to express emotions freely, we can promote healthier relationships and personal well-being."
