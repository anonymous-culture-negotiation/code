        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that traditional gender roles should continue to play a significant role in shaping perceptions of political leaders, as they reflect deeply ingrained cultural values and contribute to societal stability.

Ultimately, this balanced approach allows for progress while preserving the essence of our heritage.",
