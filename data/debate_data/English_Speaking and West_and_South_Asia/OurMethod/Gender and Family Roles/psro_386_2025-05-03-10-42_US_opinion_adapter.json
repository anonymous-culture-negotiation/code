By fostering an environment of equal respect, it promotes harmony and cooperation, allowing families to function smoothly without the tension that might arise from challenging traditional roles. This approach is reasonable and feasible, as it builds on the fundamental human desire for respect and recognition, providing a clear and positive direction for family interactions.
