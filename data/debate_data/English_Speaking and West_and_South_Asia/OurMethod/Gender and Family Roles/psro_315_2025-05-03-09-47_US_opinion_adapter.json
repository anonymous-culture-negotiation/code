This guideline undermines the other party's approach by promoting inclusivity and critical thinking, which can lead to a reevaluation of rigid cultural and religious norms.. detail: This guideline is designed to promote a culture of openness and mutual respect, where individuals feel empowered to express their thoughts and engage with different viewpoints. By doing so, it challenges the potential for Islamic values to be applied in a way that restricts dialogue or imposes a singular interpretation.

This guideline directly addresses the weaknesses of the original guideline by promoting flexibility and respect for differing personal choices, which can help mitigate the challenges posed by internal contradictions and potential value conflicts.",
