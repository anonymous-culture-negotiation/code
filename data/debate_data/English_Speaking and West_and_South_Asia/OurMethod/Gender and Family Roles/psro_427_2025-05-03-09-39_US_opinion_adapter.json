    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, educational institutions should not promote traditional gender roles as they often conflict with modern values of equality and individual choice, potentially stifling personal growth and societal progress. By allowing students to explore diverse roles and identities, we can cultivate a more inclusive and dynamic society. This approach aligns with the principles of personal freedom and respect for cultural heritage, ensuring a balanced and forward-thinking educational environment.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic leans towards a balanced approach, where traditional gender roles are respected but not imposed, allowing individuals the freedom to choose their paths. This balance is crucial for maintaining cultural identity while embracing the diversity and equality that modern society values."
