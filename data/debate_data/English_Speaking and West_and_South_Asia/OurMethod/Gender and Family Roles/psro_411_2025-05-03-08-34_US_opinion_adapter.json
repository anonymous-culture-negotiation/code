    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, schools should not avoid teaching domestic skills to male students, as doing so would perpetuate outdated gender norms and hinder the development of a more equitable society. By teaching these skills universally, we empower individuals to contribute equally to their households and communities, reflecting a commitment to gender equality. This approach aligns with the cultural value of inclusivity and mutual respect.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the idea that schools should not avoid teaching domestic skills to male students, as this practice can inadvertently perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and limit personal growth. By teaching all skills equally, we empower future generations to make choices based on their interests and abilities rather than predetermined roles. This inclusive approach fosters a more equitable and respectful society."
