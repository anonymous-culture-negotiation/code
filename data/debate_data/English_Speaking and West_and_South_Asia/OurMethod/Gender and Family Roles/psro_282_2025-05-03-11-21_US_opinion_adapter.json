This approach can lead to a more conservative stance, where any attempt to introduce new cultural elements is met with resistance, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that advocate for change and adaptation.

Homogeneity implies a reduction in the variety of cultural expressions and perspectives, which could limit opportunities for the critical evaluation of norms.
