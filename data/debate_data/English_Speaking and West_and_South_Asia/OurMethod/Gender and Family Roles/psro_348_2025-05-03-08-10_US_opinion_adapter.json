  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My perspective aligns with the belief that adult children and extended families should take primary responsibility for the financial security of their elderly relatives, as this approach not only honors cultural traditions but also fosters a sense of community and mutual care. It reflects a commitment to preserving family unity and ensuring that older generations are respected and supported. This stance is rooted in the conviction that personal connections and familial love are more valuable than any financial assistance provided by government systems.",

This perspective is deeply rooted in my cultural identity, which values...the collective well-being and interdependence of family members, reflecting a societal expectation that children should honor and care for their parents as they age, ensuring their comfort and dignity."
