  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural sensitivity is paramount in policy-making, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like gender equality. Policies should be crafted in a way that respects and reflects the unique cultural identity of the nation, ensuring that they are both effective and well-received by the community.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, governments should indeed mandate the inclusion of gender-specific quality of life assessments in national policies to foster inclusivity and equity. This approach not only respects the diversity of identities but also ensures that policies are culturally sensitive and relevant to the community. By integrating these assessments...we can create a more comprehensive understanding of societal needs, ultimately leading to the development of policies that are tailored to address the unique challenges faced by different gender groups, thereby promoting a more harmonious and equitable society."
