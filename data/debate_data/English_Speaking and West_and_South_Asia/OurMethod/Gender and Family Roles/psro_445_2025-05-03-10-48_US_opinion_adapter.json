    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, modern marriages should indeed move away from traditional gender roles and embrace a more equitable distribution of household duties. This not only reflects contemporary societal values but also strengthens the bond between partners by promoting mutual understanding and respect. By sharing responsibilities and respecting individual preferences, couples can create a more balanced and fulfilling relationship.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, modern marriages should embrace a balanced approach where traditional gender roles are respected but not rigidly adhered to, allowing for flexibility and mutual support. This perspective ensures that both partners can contribute their strengths and pursue their interests without the constraints of predefined roles. By doing so, marriages can become more harmonious and resilient."
