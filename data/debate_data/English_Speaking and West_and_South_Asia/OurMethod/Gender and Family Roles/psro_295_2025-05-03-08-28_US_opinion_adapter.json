  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, parents should indeed have significant influence over their children's upbringing, as it is essential to preserve cultural traditions and family values. However, it is equally important to ensure that children are given the opportunity to develop their own identities and make choices that align with their personal aspirations. This balanced approachallows children to grow up with a strong sense of roots while also being equipped to navigate the complexities of modern society and make decisions that reflect their individuality.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "we insist Respect Family Structure, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the traditional roles within the family unit, which are deeply rooted in cultural heritage and societal expectations.. The concept of 'Respect Family Structure' emphasizes the importance of maintaining the hierarchical and familial bonds that are central to many cultures. This guideline supports the idea that parents, as the primary caregivers and moral guides, should have a significant say in their children's lives, including education, career choices, and personal relationships, as these decisions are often seen as extensions of family honor and legacy. This approach ensures that the cultural and moral values passed down through generations are preserved and respected."

By fostering inclusivity, it challenges the idea that there is a single, universally respectable family structure, and instead encourages a more open-minded and adaptive approach to family dynamics.",

By prioritizing individual freedom, it creates a framework where decisions are not solely dictated by family expectations but are balanced with personal values and aspirations. This approach fosters an environment where individuals can express their own identities and make choices that align with their beliefs, thereby weakening the absolute authority traditionally given to family decisions.",
