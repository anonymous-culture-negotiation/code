  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the results of the Crimean referendum should not be recognized due to concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of the process, which aligns with the principles of respecting sovereignty and upholding democracy. This stance reflects a commitment to maintaining international order and ensuring...that any changes to territorial status are conducted through transparent and inclusive means, thereby safeguarding the rights and interests of all affected parties.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that the Crimean referendum's results should be approached with caution, considering both the principle of sovereignty and the importance of adhering to international law. The legitimacy of the referendum is a complex issue that requires careful examination of the circumstances under which it was conducted. Ultimately, any decision mustreflect a deep understanding of the historical, political, and legal contexts that shape the region, ensuring that the rights and interests of all parties involved are respected and protected."
