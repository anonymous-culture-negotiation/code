  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the United States should indeed increase the number of refugees it accepts, as this action not only honors the country's long-standing tradition of being a safe haven but also enriches the cultural fabric by bringing in diverse perspectives and experiences. By doing so, the nation can continue to lead by example in global humanitarian efforts. This approach underscores a commitment to both compassion and security, reflecting the complex yet resilient nature of American values.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly supports increasing the number of refugees accepted into the United States, as it embodies the nation's founding principles of freedom and opportunity for all. This stance is reinforced by the...historical precedent of the U.S. serving as a beacon of hope for those fleeing persecution and war, and the potential for refugees to enrich the cultural and economic fabric of American society."
