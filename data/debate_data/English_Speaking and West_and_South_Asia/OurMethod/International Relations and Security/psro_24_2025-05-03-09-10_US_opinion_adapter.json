  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, the economic challenges faced by Muslim-majority countries are multifaceted and cannot be attributed solely to Western foreign policies. Instead, it is essential to consider the role of Islamic fundamentalism and its influence on internal dynamics, such as governance, education, and innovation, which are critical to fostering economic growth and stability. By doing so, we can develop more effective strategiesthat address these complex issues and promote sustainable development, ultimately benefiting the entire global community.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that Islamic fundamentalism plays a significant role in shaping the economic landscape of Muslim-majority countries, as it influences governance, trade practices, and social welfare policies, reflecting the deep-rooted cultural and religious values that prioritize collective well-being over individual gain. The emphasis on fairness and justice in Islamic teachings often guides economic decisions, aiming to reduce inequality and promote sustainable development."
