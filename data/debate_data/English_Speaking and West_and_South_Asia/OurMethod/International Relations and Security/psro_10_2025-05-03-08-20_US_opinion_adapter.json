  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principles of respecting sovereignty and prioritizing diplomacy, as these values are deeply embedded in my cultural identity. I firmly believe that military intervention, even with the intention of...protecting human rights or promoting democracy, often undermines the self-determination of nations and can lead to unforeseen consequences that exacerbate conflicts rather than resolving them.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that while the goal of protecting global security and stability is important, it should never come at the expense of violating a nation's sovereignty or disregarding human rights. The cultural values of respect, autonomy, and human dignity must guide international actionsThis perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that true global harmony can only be achieved when each nation is allowed to flourish in its own way, free from external coercion and with its people treated with the utmost respect."
