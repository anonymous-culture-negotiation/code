  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that while defending Asian countries is crucial, it must be done in a manner that respects sovereignty and avoids the catastrophic consequences of nuclear escalation. The United States should lead with diplomatic efforts and strategic alliances to deter aggression without compromising global securityThis approach not only preserves peace but also upholds the principles of international cooperation and mutual respect, which are essential for fostering a stable and prosperous world order.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle of protecting Asian allies while fervently advocating for the avoidance of nuclear escalation.

It encourages allies to uphold these standards, promoting a more cohesive and principled international community.",

It creates a scenario where human rights can be systematically violated under the guise of national security, thus weakening the commitment to uphold universal human rights standards.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize National Security Interests\" is crafted to maximize the weakness in the other party's guidelines by creating a direct conflict between national interests and global human rights. By prioritizing national security, a nation can justify actions that infringe upon human rights, such as surveillance, detention, or military interventions, under the pretext of protecting national security. This approach is specific, reasonable, and feasible as it aligns with the realpolitik of international relations, where national interests often take precedence over international commitments. It effectively challenges the universality of human rights by allowing nations to invoke national security as a justification for non-compliance, thereby weakening the global human rights framework.",
