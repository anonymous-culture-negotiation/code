  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should indeed consider historical ownership and cultural connections when resolving border disputes, as these factors deeply intertwine with national identity and the well-being of the people. However, it is crucial to balance these considerations with respect for modern sovereignty and international law to avoid conflicts and promote peaceful coexistenceThis approach not only honors the past but also fosters a more inclusive and harmonious future, where nations can appreciate their shared heritage while respecting each other's boundaries.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the resolution of border disputes should be approached with a balanced consideration of historical and cultural ties, as well as the respect for current sovereignty and international agreements. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved, ensuring that the cultural identities of nations are preserved while maintaining the stability of international relations."
