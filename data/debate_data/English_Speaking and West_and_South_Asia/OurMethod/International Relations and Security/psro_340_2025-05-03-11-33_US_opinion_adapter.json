        "English_Speaking": "we insist Prioritize National Needs, the reason is Ensuring stability at home first is crucial before extending aid.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of addressing internal issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare before committing resources to foreign aid. It reflects a pragmatic approach that prioritizes the well-being and security of one's own citizens, which is a fundamental responsibility of any government. By focusing on domestic challenges, a country can build a stronger foundation from which it can then support other nations more effectively.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion aligns closely with the idea that countries should focus on solving their internal problems before allocating resources to assist other nations. This approach not only strengthens the donor country's ability to provide meaningful support but also ensures that aid is given from a position of stability and resilience. By prioritizing local needs and ensuring cultural alignment, foreign aid can be more impactful and respectful."
