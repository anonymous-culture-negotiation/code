    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, India should prioritize diplomatic efforts and international cooperation to address terrorism, as this approach not only resonates with its cultural heritage but also offers a pragmatic path to lasting peace. By doing so, India can maintain its leadership role in promoting global stability and human rights. This strategy reflects a deep understanding of the complexities involved in cross-border terrorism and the need for collaborative solutions.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the matter is that India should prioritize diplomatic efforts and dialogue with Pakistan to address the issue of terrorism, rather than resorting to military force. This approach not only respects the sovereignty of Pakistan but also aligns with India's cultural values of non-violence and peaceful resolution. By engaging in meaningful dialogue, both countries can work together to combat terrorism effectively and foster a more stable and peaceful region."

This approach encourages a more nuanced understanding of sovereignty, where respect for a nation's autonomy is balanced with the responsibility to protect human dignity and justice.

By doing so, it narrows the applicability of nonviolent diplomacy to a select group, potentially excluding scenarios where engagement with diverse or opposing viewpoints could lead to more comprehensive and inclusive solutions. This approach weakens the guideline of nonviolent diplomacy by reducing its potential impact and limiting its ability to address conflicts across different cultural and political landscapes.",
