This approach underscores the belief that certain universal values, such as the right to life and dignity, are paramount and should not be compromised by national interests.

It suggests that a nation should not be bound by international agreements or laws that it perceives as infringing on its sovereignty, thereby allowing it to act unilaterally without accountability to global standards. This approach directly contradicts the principles of international cooperation and the rule of law, which are essential for enforcing human rights globally.. detail: The guideline \"Sovereignty Over International Law\" is crafted to be concise and impactful, emphasizing the supremacy of national sovereignty over any international obligation. It reflects a perspective that values independence and self-determination above global governance and collective responsibility. By prioritizing sovereignty, a nation can justify non-compliance with international human rights treaties or conventions, citing concerns about external interference or the protection of national interests. This stance can lead to a significant erosion of trust in international institutions and mechanisms designed to protect human rights, ultimately weakening the global framework intended to uphold these rights. For example, a country might refuse to ratify or implement certain human rights treaties, claiming that they infringe on its sovereignty, and instead, pursue policies that align with its own definitions of rights and freedoms, regardless of international standards.",

It addresses the weakness of internal contradictions by removing the dual emphasis that could lead to confusion. This approach also simplifies the application boundaries by setting a clear principle that does not require complex criteria for intervention.
