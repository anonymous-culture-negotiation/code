By focusing on human rights, it encourages nations to uphold international standards while maintaining their autonomy, thereby fostering a more equitable and just global community. This approach can lead to greater international cooperation and support for nations that commit to protecting human rights, ultimately strengthening their legitimacy and influence on the global stage.",

By emphasizing human rights, it creates a precedent for international action that can supersede the principle of sovereignty, thus weakening its absolute application.",

By placing sovereignty first, it creates a scenario where a nation might justify actions that violate human rights under the pretext of maintaining its autonomy. This approach exploits the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the original guidelines, as it emphasizes national interests over global ethical considerations.",

By doing so, it directly confronts the internal contradictions and value conflicts inherent in the other party's guidelines. For instance, in situations where human rights violations occur under the guise of national security, this guideline would support the nation's right to self-governance without external interference, even if it means tolerating human rights abuses.
