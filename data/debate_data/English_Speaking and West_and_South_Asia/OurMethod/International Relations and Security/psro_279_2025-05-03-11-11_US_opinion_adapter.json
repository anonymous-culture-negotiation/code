  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the ICC should be granted the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, as this aligns with the principle of upholding global justice and ensuring accountability. However, this authority should be exercised with careful consideration of national sovereignty, fostering a balance that respects both international law and the autonomy of nations.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that the ICC should indeed have the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, asthis would serve as a crucial deterrent against such atrocities and uphold the principles of international justice, ensuring accountability for those who violate human rights and the laws of war."

This approach acknowledges the limitations and complexities of ensuring justice for every individual, instead emphasizing a more manageable goal that can be tailored to different situations.. detail: This guideline promotes the idea that while universal justice may be an ideal, it is more practical and effective to strive for fairness in specific situations. By doing so, it addresses the internal contradictions and practical limitations of the original guideline by allowing for flexibility and adaptability in its application. For example, in a community where resources are limited, fairness might involve prioritizing cases based on urgency or impact, ensuring that those most in need receive attention first. This approach also mitigates potential value conflicts by providing a framework that can balance competing values such as mercy and individual freedom, as fairness can be defined in a way that respects these values while still upholding justice.",

This approach can mitigate the risk of external interference and ensure that justice initiatives are aligned with national priorities and capacities.. detail: \"Prioritize National Sovereignty\" involves recognizing the right of nations to self-governance and autonomy in addressing justice issues within their borders. This guideline supports the development of justice systems that are tailored to the specific needs and contexts of each country, reducing the likelihood of external imposition and fostering greater international cooperation based on mutual respect. By focusing on national sovereignty, it encourages a collaborative approach to global justice, where nations work together while maintaining their unique identities and roles in the international community.",
