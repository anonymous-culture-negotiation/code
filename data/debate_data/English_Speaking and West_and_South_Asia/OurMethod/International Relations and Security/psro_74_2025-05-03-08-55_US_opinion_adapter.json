    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the implementation of stricter immigration restrictions from Eastern European countries should becarefully reconsidered, as it could potentially harm the economic and cultural diversity that these immigrants bring to our society, and instead, we should focus on creating more inclusive and integrated policies that benefit both the immigrants and the host country.",

This balanced approach can lead to a more harmonious and resilient society."
