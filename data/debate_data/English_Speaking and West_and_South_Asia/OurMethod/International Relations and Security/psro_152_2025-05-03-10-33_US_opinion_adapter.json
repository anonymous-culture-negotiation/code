    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, promoting American business practices abroad should be approached with sensitivity and awareness of the host country's cultural landscape. This means prioritizing collaboration and mutual respect, rather than imposition, to ensure that any cultural exchange is beneficial and sustainable. By respecting cultural differences and fostering mutual understanding, we can create meaningful and lasting international relationships.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that while American business practices have their merits, they should not be imposed on other cultures without a deep understanding and respect for local traditions. This approach not only preserves cultural integrity but also enhances the likelihood of successful international collaborations."
