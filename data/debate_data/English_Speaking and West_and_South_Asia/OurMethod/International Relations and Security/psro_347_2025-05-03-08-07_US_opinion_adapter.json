This approach can lead to the justification of practices that violate human rights, based on cultural norms rather than universal standards.. detail: By respecting local customs over universal rights, this guideline fosters a culture of cultural relativism, which can justify practices that are harmful or discriminatory. This approach undermines the universal application of human rights, as it allows for the prioritization of local norms over internationally recognized rights. The guideline is specific, clear, and feasible, as it provides a straightforward direction on how to handle cultural differences, thus directly challenging the other party's guidelines that advocate for the universal respect of human rights.",
