By prioritizing human rights, it creates a framework that encourages inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives, potentially weakening the other party's stance on strict border control.. detail: This guideline suggests that the protection and promotion of human rights should take precedence over the defense of borders. It implies a shift in focus from national security to individual freedoms, which can lead to more open and inclusive immigration policies. For example, prioritizing human rights might involve ensuring that asylum seekers are treated with dignity and fairness, regardless of their country of origin.
