This guideline emphasizes the importance of recognizing and respecting the sovereignty of nations, including Syria, in their internal conflicts and governance. It aligns with the cultural value of self-determination and the belief that external intervention can often exacerbate conflicts rather than resolve them. This perspective is rooted in a historical understanding of colonialism and the impact of foreign interference on local cultures and societies."

It encourages a nuanced approach where sovereignty is not the sole consideration, but rather one of many factors, including human dignity and justice.
