  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, NATO member states should unequivocally stand by their commitment to defend an ally under attack, as this action embodies the core principles of unity and collective responsibility that define the alliance. By doing so, they reinforce the credibility of NATO's deterrence and uphold the values of democracy and freedom. This stance is essential for maintaining peace and security in the face of potential threats.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the decision for NATO member states to use military force in defense of an ally under attack by Russia should be guided by a careful consideration ofthe strategic implications and potential consequences of such an action, weighing the importance of upholding collective defense commitments against the risks of escalating tensions and the broader geopolitical landscape."
