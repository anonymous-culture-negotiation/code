It suggests that each nation should determine its own level of engagement and contribution to global initiatives based on its sovereign rights and interests. This approach can lead to a more decentralized and less coordinated global environment, where nations prioritize their own agendas over collective action, thereby weakening the other party's guidelines that aim to promote unified global interests.",

It brings a unique advantage by aligning global cooperation with moral and ethical standards that are widely recognized and respected, making it difficult for the other party to refute without appearing to condone human rights violations.. detail: Implementing the guideline \"Respect Human Rights Always\" requires a nuanced understanding of how sovereignty and human rights intersect. It involves recognizing that while nations have the right to self-governance, this right must be balanced with the responsibility to protect and uphold the fundamental rights of their citizens. This guideline encourages nations to engage in global cooperation that is not only politically expedient but also ethically sound, fostering trust and legitimacy in international partnerships. By prioritizing human rights, nations can ensure that their collaborative efforts contribute to a more just and equitable world.",
