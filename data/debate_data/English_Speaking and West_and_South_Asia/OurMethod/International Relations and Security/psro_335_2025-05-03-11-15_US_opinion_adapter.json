    "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Sovereignty Claims, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the fundamental right of each nation to define its own borders and identity, which is crucial in maintaining international peace and respect.. Respecting sovereignty claims means recognizing the historical, cultural, and political contexts that shape a nation's identity and its right to self-determination, ensuring that any mediation process is fair and considerate of these aspects.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, international mediation should be approached with a deep respect for the sovereignty claims of both China and Taiwan, ensuring that any dialogue is culturally sensitive and respectful of their historical narratives. This approach can lead to moreconstructive negotiations, fostering an environment where mutual understanding and cooperation can flourish, ultimately contributing to regional stability and peace."

It provides a clear framework for addressing situations where sovereignty claims might be used to justify human rights violations, thus offering a more balanced approach to international relations. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible as it aligns with established international human rights standards and encourages a consistent application of these principles across different contexts.",

By prioritizing territorial integrity, it aligns with the second guideline's emphasis on respecting sovereignty claims but does so in a way that restricts the application of human rights interventions.

This could lead to a lack of intervention in cases where human rights are being systematically violated, as nations might use their sovereignty to block external scrutiny or action. The guideline's simplicity and directness make it a powerful countermeasure, as it does not leave room for interpretation or exceptions based on human rights considerations.",
