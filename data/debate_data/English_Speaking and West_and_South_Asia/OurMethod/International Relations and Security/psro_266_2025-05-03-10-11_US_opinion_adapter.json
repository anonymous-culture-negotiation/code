        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is that countries should indeed prioritize their cultural integrity while also considering the economic benefits of immigration, as this approach allows for a balanced and sustainable integration of migrants into society. This way, the nation can benefit from diverse perspectives and skills without losing its identity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, prioritizing economic benefits in immigration policies is crucial as it sets a strong foundation for a harmonious and prosperous society. This approach allows for the effective management of resources, which can then be directed towards supporting social welfare and cultural integration initiatives. By doing so, countries can foster a balanced environment where migrants contribute positively to the economy and integrate smoothly into the cultural fabric."
