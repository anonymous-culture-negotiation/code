  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the United States should not prioritize its counterterrorism strategies solely based on its alliance with Israel, as doing so might compromise its ability to address broader global security threats and uphold its commitment to universal human rights. By focusing on its core values and respectingthe sovereignty of all nations, the U.S. can foster a more balanced approach to counterterrorism that aligns with both its national interests and global ethical standards.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the importance of maintaining strong alliances while respecting the sovereignty of nations. This dual approach allows for a balanced strategy that leverages collective strengths while addressing unique cultural and security needs. By prioritizing both honor and respect, the United States can navigate complex global landscapes with integrity and effectiveness."
