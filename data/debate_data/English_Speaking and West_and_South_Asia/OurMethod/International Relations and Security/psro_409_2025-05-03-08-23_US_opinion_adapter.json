  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is that nations should indeed implement stricter immigration policies when faced with terrorism-related threats, but these policies must be crafted with careful consideration of human rights and the ethical implications of limiting migration. This approach not only safeguards national security but also upholds the moral obligation to protect vulnerable individuals. Bybalancing these two priorities, countries can effectively mitigate risks while preserving the integrity of their values and commitments to global humanitarian standards, ensuring that the measures taken are both prudent and just.",

This approach not...only ensures the protection of citizens from potential threats but also upholds the moral obligation to provide refuge to those genuinely fleeing persecution or violence, thus preserving the integrity of both national security and human rights."
