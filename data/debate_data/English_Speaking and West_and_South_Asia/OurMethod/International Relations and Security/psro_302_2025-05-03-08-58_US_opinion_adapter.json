    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the pursuit of independent statehood by Palestinians should be approached with a profound respect for their cultural heritage and an unwavering commitment to upholding their dignity. This dual approach not only strengthens their position but also ensures that their actions remain true to their core values. Ultimately, it is through this balanced strategy that Palestinians can navigate the complexities of their situation with integrityBy doing so, they can effectively assert their rights while preserving the richness of their cultural identity, fostering a sense of unity and purpose that guides them through their journey towards self-determination.",

It suggests that while peaceful means should always be the first choice, there should be a willingness to adapt and employ other strategies when necessary to protect vulnerable parties or address significant injustices.
