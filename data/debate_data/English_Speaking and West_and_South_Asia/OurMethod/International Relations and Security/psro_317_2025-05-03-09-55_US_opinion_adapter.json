This guideline emphasizes the importance of respecting the privacy of foreign heads of state and other leaders, as it reflects a commitment to universal human rights and the belief that surveillance should not be used as a tool to undermine sovereignty or dignity. It suggests that national security concerns should be addressed through diplomatic and cooperative means rather than through secretive and potentially harmful surveillance practices."
