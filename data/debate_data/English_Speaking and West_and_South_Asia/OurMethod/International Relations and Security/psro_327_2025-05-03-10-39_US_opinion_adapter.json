  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the international community should focus on supporting diplomatic efforts rather than imposing solutions, allowing the parties involved to take ownership of their peace process. This approach respects the cultural and historical contexts of the conflict, fostering a more sustainable and equitable resolution. By prioritizing dialogue and sovereignty, we can create a framework that honors the unique identities and interests of both Israelis and Palestinians.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that while the international community has a role to play in supporting peace efforts, it is crucial to do so in a manner that respects the sovereignty and cultural identities of both Israelis and Palestinians. This approachrequires a deep understanding of the historical context and the nuances of the conflict, ensuring that any external intervention is tailored to address the unique challenges and aspirations of each side, fostering a lasting and inclusive peace."
