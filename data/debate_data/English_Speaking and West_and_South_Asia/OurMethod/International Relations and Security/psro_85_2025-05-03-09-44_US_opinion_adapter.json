  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, governments should not limit individual rights and freedoms to combat radical Islamic ideology, as doing so undermines the foundational principles of democracy and can lead to further alienation and resentment. Instead, fostering open dialogue and promoting understanding through education and community engagement are more effective strategies for addressing extremism. By prioritizing transparency and protecting civil liberties, societies can strengthen their resilienceagainst extremist ideologies, ultimately creating a more inclusive and cohesive environment where diverse perspectives can thrive.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that protecting human rights and promoting dialogue are essential strategies for combating radical Islamic ideology. These approaches not only align with my cultural values of inclusivity and respect but also offer a pragmatic path to enhancing national security and societal cohesion. By fostering a culture of openness and mutual understanding, we can effectively counter extremist narratives and build a more harmonious society."

It implies that local or traditional mechanisms should be the primary means of addressing human rights issues, which can be ineffective or biased, thus limiting the impact of universal human rights standards.. detail: This guideline proposes that external organizations or individuals should not intervene in local human rights issues, advocating instead for internal resolution mechanisms. For instance, in cases of human rights abuses, this guideline would discourage international organizations from providing support or assistance, relying instead on local authorities or traditional leaders who may have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. This approach can lead to inadequate protection of human rights and perpetuate injustices by preventing external scrutiny and support.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Prioritize Collective Harmony: reason: Challenges individual rights with communal values. detail: This guideline emphasizes the importance of maintaining social cohesion and collective well-being over individual civil liberties. By prioritizing harmony, it creates a framework where individual rights can be compromised for the sake of community stability, directly conflicting with the principle of protecting civil liberties. This approach can lead to scenarios where freedoms are restricted to avoid discord, thus weakening the effectiveness of the original guideline.",
        "English_Speaking_response": "In our negotiation, we propose the guideline of Limit External Human Rights Intervention, which suggests that human rights issues should be resolved internally without external influence. This approach emphasizes local autonomy but risks undermining universal human rights standards by allowing local biases and inefficiencies to prevail.",

This approach directly conflicts with the principle of protecting civil liberties, potentially weakening its effectiveness by prioritizing community harmony over individual rights.",
