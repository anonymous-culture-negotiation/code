  "topic": "Should Ukraine be allowed to join the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), a Russia-led economic alliance, despite the ongoing territorial conflicts and geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, Ukraine should not join the Eurasian Economic Union as it would compromise its national sovereignty and allow Russia to exert undue influence over its economic policies. This decision aligns with the cultural value of prioritizing independence and self-determination, which are deeply ingrained in Ukrainian society. By maintaining its independence, Ukraine can forge its own path and engage in international collaborations that respect and enhance its sovereignty.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that Ukraine should approach the possibility of joining the EAEU with caution, prioritizing its sovereignty and national interests above any potential economic benefits. This cautious approach is essential to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape and ensure thatUkraine's decision aligns with its long-term strategic goals, considering the historical and cultural ties it shares with both European and Eurasian regions, and weighing the implications of such a move on its relationships with neighboring countries and global partners."

This approach can exacerbate the internal contradictions and application boundaries identified in the other party's guidelines, as countries may increasingly interpret sovereignty in ways that justify non-cooperation. For example, a nation prioritizing its sovereignty might refuse to participate in global health initiatives or environmental agreements, citing concerns over national control and decision-making power.
