  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the implementation of stricter immigration policies, as it aligns with the fundamental need to protect and preserve our national identity and ensure domestic security. By doing so, we can maintain the integrity of our cultural heritage and safeguard our citizens from potential threats. This approach not only fosters a sense of national pride but also promotes a secure and stable environment for future generations.",

While it is important to safeguard national identity and ensurepublic safety, it is equally crucial to balance these concerns with the potential economic and social benefits that immigration can bring, such as diversity and workforce enrichment."
