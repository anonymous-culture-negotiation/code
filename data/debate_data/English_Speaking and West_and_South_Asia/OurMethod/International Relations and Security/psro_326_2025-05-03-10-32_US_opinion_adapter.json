    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of self-destructive explosive devices by local forces against Western military targets in situations of foreign occupation should be approached with caution and consideration for the potential consequences on civilian lives. It isessential to weigh the strategic benefits against the moral implications and potential for harm to innocent bystanders, as the repercussions can be far-reaching and devastating.",
