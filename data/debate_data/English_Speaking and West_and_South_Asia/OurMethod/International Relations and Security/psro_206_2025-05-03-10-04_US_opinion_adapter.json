Ultimately, any policy should be guided by a commitment to transparency and fairness, reflecting the corevalues of our society and ensuring that such decisions do not inadvertently harm innocent parties or disrupt global stability.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the decision to allow or ban Middle Eastern companies from managing essential facilities in Western nations should be guided by a careful assessment of national security risks and the potential benefits of international cooperation. By prioritizing national interests while fostering global partnerships, Western nations can navigate this complex issue effectively.

By emphasizing national sovereignty, it challenges the universal application of human rights and suggests that national laws and interests should take precedence over global human rights norms.
