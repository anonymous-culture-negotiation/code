    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the importance of respecting sovereignty and upholding international law, as these principles are foundational to maintaining peace and order in the world.

    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should not be allowed to intervene militarily in other sovereign nations under the pretext of national security, as this action violates fundamental principles of international law and respect for sovereignty. Such interventions oftenlead to destabilization and exacerbate conflicts, causing irreparable harm to the invaded nation and its people, as seen in numerous historical examples where foreign military intervention has resulted in prolonged instability and suffering."

It provides a clear framework for intervention when a nation's actions violate fundamental rights, thus resolving the ambiguity and moral dilemmas that arise from strict adherence to sovereignty. By placing human rights at the forefront, it ensures that the protection of individuals is not compromised by political boundaries, fostering a more equitable and just international community.",

This approach is reasonable and feasible as it leverages existing international frameworks and encourages dialogue, which can lead to more harmonious and equitable solutions in global affairs. By fostering cooperation, it undermines the rigid application of sovereignty, allowing for more flexible and adaptive approaches to international challenges, and thus maximally weakens the effectiveness of the \"Respect Sovereignty\" guideline in scenarios where cooperation is preferable to isolation.",
