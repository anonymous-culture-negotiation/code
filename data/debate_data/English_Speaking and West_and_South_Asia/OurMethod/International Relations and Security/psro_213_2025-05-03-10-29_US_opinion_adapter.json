        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of drones in conflict zones should be subject to stringent regulations to minimize harm to civilians, reflecting a commitment to upholding human rights and protecting innocent lives. This approach aligns with the cultural values of compassion and justice, emphasizing the need for accountability and transparency in military operations. By prioritizing civilian safety, we can work towards a more humane and equitable resolution to conflicts.",
