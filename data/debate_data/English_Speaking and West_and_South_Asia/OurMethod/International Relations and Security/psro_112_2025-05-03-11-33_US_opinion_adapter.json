  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the justification for military interventions to secure resources is deeply flawed, as it undermines the principles of sovereignty and diplomacy that are essential for global harmony. These interventions often lead to widespread suffering and undermine trust among nations, contradicting the values of respect and cooperation that should guide international relations. Ultimately, prioritizing peaceful and collaborative approaches is the only path to true stability and progress.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, countries should not engage in military interventions to secure resources, as this approach undermines global stability and violates the sovereignty of other nations. Instead, diplomatic efforts and international cooperation should be pursued to ensure equitable access to vital resourcesThis perspective is rooted in the belief that peaceful negotiations and collaborative agreements can effectively address resource needs without resorting to conflict, thereby fostering a more harmonious and interconnected world."

This approach can foster a sense of self-reliance and skepticism towards international bodies, making it difficult to achieve collective action and undermining the effectiveness of global cooperation initiatives. It encourages nations to focus on their own agendas, potentially leading to a fragmented international community where cooperation is minimal and only occurs when it serves immediate national interests.",

This approach aligns with the principle of non-interference, which is a cornerstone of international relations. However, it undermines the humanitarian aspect of the original guidelines, potentially leading to more unchecked human rights violations. The clarity and specificity of this guideline make it reasonable and feasible, as it provides a straightforward direction that can be easily understood and implemented by nations.",

This stance is rooted in the belief that a nation's primary responsibility is to its citizens, and thus, it should not compromise its interests for the sake of broader international objectives.",
