    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that governments should limit or prohibit foreign entities from acquiring domestic companies to protect national economic independence and security. This stance is rooted in the belief that maintaining control over domestic assets is essential for preserving cultural identity and ensuring economic stability. By prioritizing national ownership and transparency, we can foster a resilient economy that reflects our core values ofself-reliance and sovereignty, ultimately safeguarding our nation's future prosperity and cultural integrity.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the protection of national assets is paramount to preserving cultural identity and economic sovereignty. This stance aligns with the cultural tradition of prioritizing self-reliance and national security, ensuring that domestic companies remain under local control. By doing so, a nation can uphold its core values and make decisions that benefit its own people, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose."
