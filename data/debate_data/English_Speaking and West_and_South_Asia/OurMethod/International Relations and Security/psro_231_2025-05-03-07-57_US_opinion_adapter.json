    "English_Speaking": "In my view, European countries should indeed take on a significant role in addressing global issues, leveraging their resources and influence to drive meaningful change.

    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, European countrieshave often been perceived as prioritizing economic interests over cultural preservation, which can lead to a loss of traditional practices and community cohesion in regions like West and South Asia."

This approach not only fosters a sense of ownership and accountability at the local level but also encourages innovation and adaptability, as solutions are developed in response to specific cultural and environmental contexts.
