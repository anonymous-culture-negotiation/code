  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the EU should continue to allow unrestricted freedom of movement for workers, as it aligns with the principles of economic integration and mutual benefit. However, this should be done with careful consideration of preserving national identities, ensuring that cultural diversity remains a strength of the EU. By balancing these aspects, the EU can foster both economic growth and culturalharmony, ultimately enhancing the overall unity and prosperity of its member states.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the EU should strive to balance the preservation of national identities with the promotion of economic integration, recognizing that both are interdependent and essential for a thriving European community. By respecting national identities, the EU can ensure that each member state contributesits unique cultural and historical perspectives to the collective European identity, fostering a rich tapestry of diversity and cooperation that strengthens the union as a whole."
