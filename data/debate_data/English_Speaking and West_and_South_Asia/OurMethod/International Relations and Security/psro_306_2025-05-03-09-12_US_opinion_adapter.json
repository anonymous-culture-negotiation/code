  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural preservation is essential for national identity, yet it should not come at the cost of inclusivity and diversity. Implementing policies that respect both the host culture and immigrant contributions can lead to a more vibrant and cohesive society. By prioritizing cultural integrity and fostering respectful diversity, nations can navigate the challenges of global interconnectedness effectively.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that nations should indeed implement stricter immigration policies to safeguard their cultural heritage, as this allows for the preservation of traditions and values that are integral to their identity. However, these policies must be balanced with an openness to diversity to ensure cultural enrichment and global harmony. By doing so, nations can navigate the challenges of globalization while maintaining their unique cultural footprintThis balanced approach not only protects the cultural essence of a nation but also fosters an environment where diverse perspectives can coexist, leading to a more vibrant and inclusive society."

By doing so, it creates a clear conflict with the other party's objectives, potentially leading to inconsistencies in policy implementation.. detail: This guideline suggests that cultural practices and traditions should be maintained even if they do not align with contemporary notions of equity and inclusion. For example, if a cultural tradition involves exclusive practices that have been passed down through generations, this guideline would advocate for their continuation, regardless of whether they are perceived as discriminatory by modern standards.
