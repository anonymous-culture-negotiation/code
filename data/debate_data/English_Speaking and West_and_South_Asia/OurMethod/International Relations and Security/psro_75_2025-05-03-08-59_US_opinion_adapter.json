    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion is that the Taliban's governance of Afghanistan since 2021 should be recognized as a significant threat to global security due to its blatant disregard for human rights and democratic principles. This perspective aligns with the cultural values of many nations that prioritize freedom, equality, and justice. The international community must remain vigilant and proactive in addressing the challenges posed by the Taliban's rule to safeguard global peace and stability.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the importance of respecting Afghanistan's cultural sovereignty while also prioritizing universal human rights. This balanced approach allows for a more informed and empathetic understanding of the Taliban's governance, acknowledging both the cultural context and the global responsibility to uphold human dignity."
