        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Intervene with Empathy Always: reason: It directly challenges the ambiguity of non-interference by prioritizing empathetic action over passive respect for autonomy, addressing the internal contradictions and potential value conflicts inherent in the non-interference principle.. detail: This guideline emphasizes the importance of actively engaging with others when they are in need, ensuring that support is provided while still respecting individual autonomy. It encourages a proactive approach that balances respect for others with a commitment to their well-being, thus mitigating the confusion and inconsistent application often seen with non-interference.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Prioritize Human Rights: reason: This guideline challenges the potential value conflicts that arise when respecting sovereignty might lead to overlooking human rights abuses. By prioritizing human rights, it ensures that the principle of sovereignty does not supersede ethical imperatives. This approach fosters a more balanced and just international environment where the dignity and well-being of individuals are protected.. detail: Prioritizing human rights involves integrating universal human rights standards into the framework of sovereignty. This means that while respecting a nation's autonomy, there is also a commitment to uphold principles such as freedom, equality, and justice. In practice, this could involve international monitoring, diplomatic pressure, and collaborative efforts to address human rights violations. By doing so, the principle of sovereignty is reinforced with the understanding that it is not absolute but must coexist with the responsibility to protect and promote human dignity. This guideline encourages nations to view sovereignty not as a shield against accountability but as a means to ensure the welfare of their citizens and contribute to a more harmonious global community.",

This guideline can prevent necessary actions from being taken, allowing human rights violations to persist unchecked.. detail: This guideline maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by taking the principle of non-interference to an absolute level.

This approach helps to mitigate the risk of cultural insensitivity and misinterpretation, which can occur when empathy is applied without a deep understanding of the cultural context.
