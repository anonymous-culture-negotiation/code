    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, prioritizing stricter immigration controls aligns with the necessity to safeguard cultural identity and economic interests, reflecting a responsible approach to nation-building. This stance allows countries to manage immigration in a way that supports their core values and long-term sustainability, ensuring that cultural heritage and economic stability are preserved for future generations.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, countries should indeed prioritize stricter immigration controls to safeguard their cultural identity, but this must be done with careful consideration of their humanitarian obligations. By implementing policies that selectively allow immigration, nations can protect their cultural heritage while still providing refuge to those in need. This approach ensures a harmonious blend of tradition and compassion."
