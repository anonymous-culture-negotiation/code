By prioritizing harmony, it addresses the internal contradictions and value conflicts inherent in the human rights guideline, as it allows for a more flexible interpretation of rights that aligns with cultural norms and traditions.

By prioritizing cultural norms, it creates a framework where local traditions and practices are given precedence, potentially leading to the justification of actions that violate universal human rights. This approach exploits the weakness of internal contradictions within the other party's guidelines, where respecting human rights may conflict with deeply ingrained cultural practices.. detail: The guideline to prioritize cultural norms over universal rights is designed to capitalize on the potential conflicts between local cultural identities and international human rights standards. In many societies, cultural norms are deeply embedded and influence legal frameworks, social expectations, and individual behaviors. By elevating these norms above universal rights, this guideline provides a rationale for actions that might otherwise be deemed human rights violations. For example, in a culture where certain discriminatory practices are justified by tradition, this guideline could be used to defend such practices against international criticism, thus weakening the enforceability and acceptance of universal human rights.",
