This approach could result in policies that fail to address the distinct challenges faced by Indigenous communities, leading to further marginalization and undermining efforts to respect their rights. By prioritizing universal rights, this guideline can create tension with the other party's directive, which seeks to acknowledge and respect the specific rights of Indigenous peoples.",

It challenges the original guidelines' intent to respect Indigenous rights by ignoring the unique cultural practices and historical experiences of various Indigenous groups, thus undermining the inclusivity and effectiveness of any policies aimed at respecting these rights.. detail: This guideline is specific and reasonable because it reflects a simplistic approach to cultural diversity that can be feasibly implemented by ignoring the complexities of Indigenous cultures. It weakens the original guidelines by ensuring that any attempts to respect Indigenous rights are generalized and ineffective, failing to address the specific needs and realities of different Indigenous communities. This could result in policies that are broadly applied but lack the cultural sensitivity and understanding necessary to genuinely respect Indigenous rights.",
