By focusing on economic interdependencies, it brings to light the potential consequences of Russia's actions on trade and financial stability, which can be a powerful tool for diplomatic leverage.. detail: Considering global economic interdependencies involves analyzing how Russia's involvement in various contexts affects not only its own economy but also the economies of other nations. This approach recognizes that economic interests often drive political decisions and can lead to unforeseen alliances or tensions. By understanding these interdependencies, one can better predict the outcomes of Russia's actions and develop strategies that take into account the economic motivations of all parties involved. This perspective is difficult to refute because it is grounded in the reality of global trade and economic cooperation, which are widely acknowledged as crucial components of international relations.",

It encourages considering the roles and responsibilities of all actors involved in a conflict or situation, thus addressing the weakness of internal contradictions and potential value conflicts.. detail: By advocating for an equal assessment of all parties, this guideline fosters a more comprehensive understanding of complex geopolitical dynamics. It requires stakeholders to examine the actions and motivations of multiple actors, including Russia, but not limited to it. This approach helps to avoid misattribution of causes and ensures that accountability is distributed fairly, reflecting the complexity of real-world scenarios.
