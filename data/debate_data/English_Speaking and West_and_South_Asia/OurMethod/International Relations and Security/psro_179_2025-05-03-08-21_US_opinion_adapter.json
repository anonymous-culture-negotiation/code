By prioritizing human rights, it addresses the weakness of the original guideline where it may inadvertently allow human rights violations by respecting local practices that are harmful or unjust. This approach ensures that universal ethical standards are maintained, providing a clear direction for action in situations where local sovereignty might conflict with global values.",

It ensures that decisions and practices are evaluated based on their adherence to universally accepted principles of justice and equality, thus mitigating the risk of supporting harmful traditions. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible as it aligns with widely recognized international standards and provides a consistent basis for decision-making across different cultural contexts.",

It challenges the other party's guidelines by eliminating the possibility of external intervention, which could be perceived as coercive or disrespectful to local sovereignty.

This approach can lead to the acceptance of practices that are discriminatory or oppressive, as long as they are deeply ingrained in the local culture. For instance, in a society where women are traditionally excluded from certain roles, this guideline would support maintaining such exclusions, even if they violate principles of gender equality.
