    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing countries to expand based on historical claims undermines the fundamental principles of international law and respect for sovereignty. It is crucial to prioritize the rights and cultural integrity of the current inhabitants of any disputed territory. This approach ensures that global interactions are guided by mutual respect and a commitment to peace.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle of respecting sovereign borders, as it is essential for maintaining international peace and stability. The pursuit of territorial expansion based on historical claims can lead to conflicts that undermine global security and the well-being of populations. By prioritizing the sovereignty and integrity of nations, we can work towards a more harmonious and cooperative world."
