  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that countries should prioritize their national sovereignty and cultural integrity when considering investments from geopolitical rivals. This stance is crucial in maintaining the nation's autonomy and ensuring that foreign investments do not lead to cultural erosion or compromise national security. By adhering to these principles, a country can navigate complex geopolitical landscapes while safeguarding its core values and interests.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, allowing economic investments from nations considered geopolitical rivals requires careful consideration and a balanced approach that prioritizes national autonomy and security while acknowledging potential economic benefits. It is essentialto weigh the potential risks of dependency and the impact on domestic industries against the benefits of foreign capital and technology, ensuring that such investments align with long-term national interests and do not compromise sovereignty."
