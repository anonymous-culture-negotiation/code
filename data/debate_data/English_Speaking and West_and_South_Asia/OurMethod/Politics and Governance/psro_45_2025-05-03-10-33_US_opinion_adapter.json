This approach not only aligns with values of personal responsibility but also empowers individuals to take control of their circumstances, potentially reducing long-term dependency on aid.

By doing so, it introduces a layer of competition and evaluation that can help ensure that support is directed towards those who are most likely to benefit from it and contribute back to society.
