        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Prioritize Cultural Norms Always: reason: This guideline maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by consistently prioritizing cultural norms over universal human rights, thereby creating an insurmountable barrier to the implementation of human rights standards.. detail: By always prioritizing cultural norms, this guideline effectively negates the possibility of balancing cultural diversity with universal human rights. It establishes a clear hierarchy where cultural practices supersede human rights, making it impossible to address conflicts that arise from cultural practices that violate human rights. This approach is reasonable within contexts where cultural identity is paramount and any external influence, including human rights, is seen as a threat to cultural integrity. It is feasible because it aligns with the values of communities that prioritize cultural preservation and tradition, thus rendering the other party's guidelines ineffective in such scenarios.",

This approach contradicts the other party's emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all cultural heritages, as it inherently diminishes the importance of less dominant cultures.",
