    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the government should not have the authority to censor media outlets, as this action infringes upon the fundamental right to freedom of expression and the press. The balance between national security and press freedom is delicate, but it is essential to prioritize transparency and accountability, allowing the media to serve as a watchdog for the public interest. Ultimately, censorship can lead to a lack of trust in governmental institutions and undermine democratic values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that while national stability and security are crucial, they should not come at the cost of press freedom. The media plays a vital role in holding those in power accountable and providing the public with accurate information, which is essential for a functioning democracy. By prioritizing press freedom and finding alternative solutions to address security concerns, we can ensure that both our safety and our democratic values are upheld."
