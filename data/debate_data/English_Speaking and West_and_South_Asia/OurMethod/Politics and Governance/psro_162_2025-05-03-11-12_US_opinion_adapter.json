  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing non-governmental human rights organizations to function without interference is vital for upholding democratic principles and protecting human rights. These organizations serve as watchdogs, holding governments accountable and ensuring that the rights of citizens are respected. By supporting their autonomy, we reinforce the values of freedom andjustice, which are essential for a healthy and functioning democracy, ultimately fostering a society where individuals can thrive without fear of oppression or marginalization.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, non-governmental human rights organizations should operate with a deep understanding and respect for the local cultural and political context, ensuring that their efforts are harmonious with the existing governance structures. This approach not only enhances the legitimacy of their work but alsofacilitates a more effective and sustainable impact, as it allows them to address human rights issues in a manner that is both culturally sensitive and politically feasible within the region."
