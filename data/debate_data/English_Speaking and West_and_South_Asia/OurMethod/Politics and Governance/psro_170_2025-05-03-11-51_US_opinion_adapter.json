It suggests that cultural practices and beliefs should be preserved in their original form, without consideration for modern societal changes. This could lead to a rigid adherence to traditional norms, making it difficult for communities to adapt to new circumstances or embrace progressive values. For example, if a community is faced with the decision to adopt new, more efficient farming techniques, prioritizing cultural heritage might lead them to reject these innovations in favor of traditional methods, even if they are less effective.
