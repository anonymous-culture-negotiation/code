    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, prioritizing democratic values during a national crisis is essential because it fosters a sense of inclusivity and accountability, which are vital for long-term stability and progress. This approach allows for a more equitable distribution of power and resources, reducing the risk of authoritarianism and promoting a resilient and adaptive society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My perspective on this topic is shaped by the belief that while strong leadership is necessary during crises, it must be tempered by democratic principles to avoid potential abuses of power. This dual approach not only stabilizes the nation but also upholds the cultural values of justice and representation."
