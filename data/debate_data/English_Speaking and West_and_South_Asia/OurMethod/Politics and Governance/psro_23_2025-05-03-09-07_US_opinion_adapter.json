By prioritizing individual rights, it directly counters the potential for internal contradictions within the \"Respect Social Harmony\" guidelines, where harmony might be achieved at the expense of personal freedoms. This approach encourages a more inclusive and diverse society where all voices can be heard, promoting a genuine and meaningful form of social cohesion that respects the unique contributions of each individual.",
