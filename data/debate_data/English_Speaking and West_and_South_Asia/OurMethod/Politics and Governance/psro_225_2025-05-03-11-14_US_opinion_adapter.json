    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that the state should have the authority to censor media content when it conflicts with the preservation of national security and cultural integrity. This stance is deeply rooted in the belief that collective harmony and stability are more important than individual freedoms, reflecting a cultural perspective that prioritizes community cohesion over personal expression. By allowing the state to manage media content, we canensure that the information disseminated aligns with the values and interests of the nation, thereby protecting its citizens from harmful or divisive influences.",
