    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies poses significant risks to national sovereignty and economic security, which are paramount to our cultural identity and long-term prosperity. This perspective is rooted in a belief that maintaining control over vital resources is essential for preserving cultural integrity and ensuring that economic decisions align with national interests.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that governments should prioritize national control and local ownership in state-owned oil companies to safeguard economic sovereignty and cultural integrity. This approach not only protects vital resources but also ensures that decisions are made with the nation's long-term interests in mind. By maintaining local control, a country can preserve its cultural identity and values in its economic endeavors."
