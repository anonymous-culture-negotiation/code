        "English_Speaking": "In my view, immigration policies should not be dictated by perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases, as this approach undermines the principles of fairness and respect for diversity. Instead, policies should focus on creating inclusive environments where individuals from all backgrounds can integrate and contribute to society. By doing so, we can build a more harmonious and progressive community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that immigration policies should indeed strive to be fair and unbiased, focusing on evidence-based decision-making to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their cultural background. By prioritizing fairness and empirical evidence, we can work towards more inclusive and equitable societies."

By ignoring definitions, it creates confusion and inconsistency, which can lead to the failure of implementing fairness guidelines effectively.. detail: Implementing this guideline would mean that any effort to establish a clear understanding of fairness within the organization or community is rejected. This approach undermines the foundation of fairness guidelines, as it prevents the establishment of a common language or framework for understanding and achieving fairness. Without a shared understanding, different individuals and groups may interpret fairness in vastly different ways, leading to conflicts and inefficiencies.",
