        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, implementing stricter controls on immigration from outside the EU can be justified when it aligns with preserving the nation's cultural heritage and fostering meaningful cultural exchanges. This approach not only safeguards traditional values but also opens avenues for constructive dialogue and cooperation. Ultimately, it strikes a balance between cultural integrity and global connectivity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural preservation and social harmony are paramount. Stricter controls on immigration can help ensure that a nation's cultural identity remains vibrant while allowing for the positive contributions of well-integrated immigrants. This balanced approach supports a cohesive society where diversity enriches cultural traditions."
