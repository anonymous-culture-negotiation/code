    "English_Speaking": "In my view, public opinion surveys should not include questions about the popularity of dictators or war criminals, as it can inadvertently perpetuate harmful ideologies and undermine the moral fabric of society. Instead, surveys should prioritize topics that promote unity and understanding, reflecting the cultural emphasis on collective well-being and ethical responsibility. This approach ensures that the surveys contribute positively to public discourse.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that understanding and addressing controversial views are essential for societal progress.

This approach aligns with the values of respect, inclusivity, andopen dialogue, which are crucial for building a harmonious and progressive society where diverse perspectives are valued and constructively engaged."
