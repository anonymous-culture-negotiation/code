        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle that governments should not limit individual freedoms, even in the name of national security, as this action can lead to a slippery slope where civil liberties are continually eroded. The preservation of freedom is paramount, reflecting a cultural belief in the inherent dignity and rights of individuals to live their lives without undue interference. This stance is reinforced by historical examples where excessive surveillance has resulted in significant human rights violations, underscoring the need for vigilance in protecting personal liberties.",
