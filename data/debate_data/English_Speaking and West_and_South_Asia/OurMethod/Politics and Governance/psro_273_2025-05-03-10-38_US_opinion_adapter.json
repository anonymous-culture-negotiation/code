  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of each EU member state maintaining control over its borders and internal policies, which is a fundamental aspect of national sovereignty and self-determination.. The principle of respecting national sovereignty allows EU member states to tailor immigration policies according to their unique cultural, economic, and social needs, ensuring that the integration of EU citizens aligns with the specific values and traditions of each nation. This approach fosters a sense of autonomy and accountability, enabling countries to manage their resources and infrastructure effectively. It also promotes diversity in governance, reflecting the rich tapestry of cultures within the EU.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the ability of individual EU member states to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both national sovereignty and EU-wide agreements. While protecting sovereign borders is essential for maintaining cultural identityand ensuring public safety, it must be balanced with the EU's foundational principle of free movement, which fosters economic integration and cultural exchange among member states."

It ensures that national security measures are balanced with moral and ethical considerations, fostering a more inclusive and compassionate society.. detail: The \"Prioritize Human Rights\" guideline involves enacting and enforcing laws that protect the dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. This includes providing fair asylum processes, protecting against discrimination, and ensuring access to essential services like healthcare and education.
