    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between national security and individual freedoms is a delicate one, requiring careful consideration to ensure that measures taken to protect the public do not overly infringe upon personal rights. This balance is essential to maintaining trust in government and upholding the values of democracy.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that governments should indeed be allowed to limit individual civil liberties to a certain extent, but this must be done with great caution and transparency to avoid abuse of power. The key is to ensure that such measures are temporary, necessary, and proportionate to the threat, respecting the cultural value of balance between security and freedom."

This approach is specific, clear, and reasonable, as it aligns with principles of autonomy and self-determination. It is feasible because it eliminates the complexity of balancing competing values, allowing individuals to act based on their own judgment without external constraints.

This could result in resentment among individuals who feel their autonomy is being undervalued, leading to decreased motivation and participation in collective activities.
