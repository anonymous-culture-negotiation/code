        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Uphold National Sovereignty: reason: This guideline directly challenges the universal application of human rights by asserting the importance of national laws and policies over international standards. It emphasizes the right of a nation to govern itself without external interference, which can lead to conflicts with human rights that are perceived as imposed by external entities.. detail: The guideline to \"Uphold National Sovereignty\" prioritizes the authority and autonomy of a nation over international human rights norms. This can result in the justification of practices that violate human rights, under the premise of maintaining national independence and self-determination. For example, a country might resist international pressure to reform its human rights record, citing national sovereignty as a reason to maintain its current laws and policies, even if they are seen as unjust by international standards. This approach undermines the global applicability of human rights, allowing for significant deviations based on national interests.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Prioritize Cultural Norms: reason: This guideline challenges the universal application of human rights by emphasizing the importance of local cultural norms, which can sometimes conflict with broader human rights principles. By prioritizing these norms, it creates a framework where respect for human rights is secondary to cultural traditions, potentially weakening the enforcement and acceptance of universal human rights standards.. detail: This guideline suggests that cultural practices and beliefs should take precedence over generalized human rights guidelines. It acknowledges that different cultures have unique values and customs that may not align with global human rights standards. By prioritizing these norms, it encourages a more culturally sensitive approach but can lead to the marginalization of certain groups whose rights may not be recognized or protected within their local cultural context.",
        "English_Speaking_response": "Our negotiation emphasizes the principle of upholding national sovereignty, which prioritizes a nation's right to self-governance and autonomy over external influences. This perspective challenges the universal application of human rights, allowing for national laws and policies to take precedence, even if they conflict with international human rights standards.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_response": "Our new guideline, \"Prioritize Cultural Norms,\" emphasizes the importance of respecting and adhering to local cultural traditions, even if they diverge from universal human rights principles. This approach acknowledges the diversity of cultural values and encourages a more culturally sensitive perspective, though it may challenge the universality of human rights standards.",
