By demanding silence, it challenges the fundamental right to free speech and assembly, potentially leading to conflicts between protesters and authorities.. detail: The requirement for silence during protests can profoundly affect the dynamics of public demonstrations, transforming them into passive, rather than active, expressions of dissent. This can diminish the impact and visibility of protests, as the vocal expression of grievances is a crucial element of bringing attention to social issues. Moreover, enforcing silence can lead to tensions and conflicts, as protesters may resist what they perceive as an infringement on their rights, thereby complicating the implementation of the guidelines and potentially leading to disorder.",

It requires a proactive approach to identify and support vulnerable groups, ensuring that their rights and dignity are upheld, even if it means limiting certain expressions of free speech that could cause harm. This guideline fosters a more inclusive and respectful society where everyone can feel safe and valued.",

By defining these parameters, authorities can make informed decisions about how to handle protests, reducing the risk of suppressing legitimate demonstrations.
