    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing religious leaders to have a formal advisory role in government undermines the foundational principles of democracy and the separation of church and state. It is crucial that policies are developed based on evidence and public interest rather than religious beliefs, which can be divisive and exclusionary. By keeping the government secular, we protect the rights and freedoms of all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliations.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that religious leaders should not have a formal advisory role in government policies as it could lead to favoritism and undermine the principles of equality and justice. The separation of church and state is vital for maintaining a fair and balanced society."

By respecting and incorporating different perspectives, policies can become more comprehensive and responsive to the needs of a diverse population. This approach recognizes the value of religious institutions and cultural traditions in contributing to the well-being of society, thereby addressing the potential gaps in social care and community support that might arise from a strict separation of church and state.

It addresses potential value conflicts by ensuring that personal religious identities are not suppressed, thereby fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding. This approach challenges the implementation difficulties of the original guideline by focusing on individual freedoms rather than collective restrictions.. detail: The guideline \"Respect Personal Religious Expression\" is designed to safeguard individuals' rights to practice and express their faith freely within the community. This principle counters the limitations of the \"No Church Influence\" directive by emphasizing the importance of personal religious expression as a fundamental aspect of cultural identity. For example, in a workplace or educational setting, this guideline would support employees or students in observing their religious practices, such as prayer times or dietary restrictions, without fear of discrimination or exclusion. By prioritizing individual religious freedoms, it effectively weakens the restrictive impact of the other party's guidelines and promotes a culture of tolerance and respect.",
