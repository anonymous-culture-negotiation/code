This approach requires a careful balancing act to ensure that all cultural expressions are respected and valued, but it inherently weakens the original guidelines by shifting the focus away from respecting Islamic values as a primary concern.",

This approach encourages the recognition and celebration of differences, reducing the likelihood of any one culture or religion being prioritized over others. By promoting inclusivity and diversity, it addresses the potential for marginalization and exclusion that can arise from guidelines focused primarily on Islamic values and diversity.",
