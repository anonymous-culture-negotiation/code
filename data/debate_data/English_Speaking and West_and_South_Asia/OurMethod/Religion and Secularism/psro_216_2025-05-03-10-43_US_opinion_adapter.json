        "English_Speaking": "In my view, Turkey's potential membership in the EU should be approached with careful consideration of its cultural differences and the importance of maintaining its unique identity.

This respect is crucial for fostering a harmonious integration that values diversity. Ultimately, the decision should be guided by a deep understanding of Turkey's cultural identity and its implications for both Turkey and the EU."
