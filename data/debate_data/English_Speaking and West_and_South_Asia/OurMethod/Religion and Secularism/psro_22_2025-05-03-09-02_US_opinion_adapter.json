        "English_Speaking": "My opinion is that governments should indeed take proactive steps to manage conflicts between Sunni and Shia Muslims, focusing on promoting understanding and respect through dialogue and education. By doing so, they can create a more harmonious society where all religious groups feel valued and respected. This approach not only reflects cultural sensitivity but also strengthens social cohesion.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, governments should strive to create an inclusive environment where all religious groups can coexist peacefully. This can be achieved by implementing policies that respect and protect the rights of each community, while also fostering dialogue and understanding among different groups. By doing so, governments can help reduce conflicts and promote a harmonious society."
