        "English_Speaking": "In my view, maintaining a clear separation between religious beliefs and government policies is essential for a truly secular society.

This could lead to increased demands for religious accommodations in public spaces, schools, and workplaces, which may conflict with the principle of separating church and state. For instance, if a religious group demands that their holy days be observed as national holidays, it could challenge the state's ability to maintain a secular calendar.

By fostering a collaborative environment, it aims to reduce resistance from religious groups who feel marginalized by secular policies.
