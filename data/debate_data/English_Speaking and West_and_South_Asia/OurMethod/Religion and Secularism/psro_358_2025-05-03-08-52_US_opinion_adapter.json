    "English_Speaking": "In my view, governments should not impose laws that restrict individual liberties based on religious teachings, as this could lead to discrimination and undermine personal freedoms. Instead, they should strive to create a legal framework that respects cultural heritage while protecting individual rights, ensuring a balanced and inclusive society. This approach allows for the coexistence of diverse beliefs and practices, promoting social harmony and respect for all members of the community.",
