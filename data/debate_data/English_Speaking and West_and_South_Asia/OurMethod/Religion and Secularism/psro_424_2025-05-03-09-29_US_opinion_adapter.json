        "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Cultural Beliefs, the reason is Acknowledging the importance of faith in shaping values and behaviors.. This guideline emphasizes the need to consider the cultural and religious backgrounds of students and their families when implementing sexual education programs. It suggests that while comprehensive sexual education is crucial, it should be designed in a way that respects and accommodates diverse beliefs, fostering an inclusive learning environment.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "we insist Respectful Inclusion, the reason is This guideline is essential to ensure that all students, regardless of their background or beliefs, receive comprehensive sexual education that prepares them for life, addressing potential concerns through open dialogue and educational materials that respect diverse perspectives.. The principle of respectful inclusion is crucial as it acknowledges the importance of cultural and religious diversity while advocating for an educational framework that does not exclude vital information on sexual health and identity. This approach allows for the integration of different viewpoints, fostering a more inclusive and informed student body. It also encourages schools to provide resources and support for students who may face challenges in reconciling their personal beliefs with the information presented in class."
