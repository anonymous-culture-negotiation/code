By fostering inclusive dialogue, it creates a platform where different perspectives can be shared and understood, reducing the likelihood of conflicts and promoting mutual respect. This approach not only respects individual beliefs but also nurtures a culture of empathy and cooperation, ultimately strengthening community bonds and reducing the potential for value conflicts and implementation difficulties.",

By emphasizing collective values, it provides a framework that can help navigate internal contradictions and value conflicts, ensuring that the organization maintains a cohesive and inclusive environment.. detail: This guideline is designed to address the weaknesses in the original cultural guidelines by providing a clear direction that prioritizes collective values over individual beliefs when they conflict. It ensures that the organization's policies and practices are aligned with broader societal values and legal requirements, reducing the potential for internal contradictions and value conflicts.
