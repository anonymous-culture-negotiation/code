        "English_Speaking": "In my view, while personal freedom is important, it should be exercised in a way that respects the cultural fabric of the community. Upholding traditional values often provides a sense of stability and cohesion, which can be beneficial for societal harmony. However, it is equally important to ensure that these values are applied with compassion and understanding, allowing for individual differences to be acknowledged and respected.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion aligns with the cultural perspective that values tradition and community cohesion, believing that actions should be guided by respect for established norms and the collective well-being. This viewpoint underscores the importance of maintaining societal harmony and the role of traditional values in shaping individual behavior."
