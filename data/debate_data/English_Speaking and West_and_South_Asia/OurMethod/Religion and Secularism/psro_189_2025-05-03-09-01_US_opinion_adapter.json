By doing so, it addresses the weakness of cultural relativism and promotes a consistent standard of respect and inclusion across different cultures.

This approach undermines the foundational principle of prioritizing human rights, which is a cornerstone of the other party's guidelines. By ignoring human rights, it creates a scenario where cultural practices, regardless of their impact on individuals, are given precedence, leading to potential human rights violations.. detail: Implementing a guideline that ignores cultural human rights would mean that any cultural practice, no matter how harmful or discriminatory, would be allowed to continue without intervention. This could include practices such as forced marriages, female genital mutilation, or honor killings, which are deeply ingrained in some cultures but are widely recognized as human rights abuses. By prioritizing cultural practices over human rights, this guideline would create significant ethical and moral dilemmas, highlighting the weaknesses in the other party's guidelines that aim to balance cultural respect with human rights. It would force a re-evaluation of how cultural identity is respected and how human rights are protected, potentially leading to a more nuanced understanding of these complex issues.",
