        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing religious leaders to exert significant political influence could jeopardize the democratic process and lead to favoritism towards specific religious groups. This would undermine the principle of equal treatment for all citizens, which is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. By adhering to the guideline of no religious influence, we can safeguard the integrity of our democratic institutions and ensure they remain accessible and fair to everyone.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion aligns with the principle that religious leaders should not have significant influence in secular democratic governments, as it could lead to favoritism and undermine the democratic values of equality and justice. This perspective is rooted in the belief that religious influence can disrupt the balance and fairness that are essential in a democratic system. By maintaining a strict separation, we can ensure that political decisions are made with the broader interests of society in mind rather than the interests of specific religious groups."
