    "English_Speaking": "In my view, balancing religious perspectives and secular values is indispensable for maintaining social cohesion and ensuring that all citizens feel represented and respected. This balance allows for the preservation of cultural heritage while embracing diversity and fostering an inclusive society.",

By doing so, governments can ensure that all citizens, whether religious or secular,feel equally valued and protected under the law, fostering a harmonious and inclusive environment that promotes social cohesion and stability."
