    "English_Speaking": "In my view, Western societies should approach the accommodation of traditional Islamic practices with a thoughtful balance that respects both the cultural heritage of the West and the diversity of its inhabitants. This involves creating inclusive environments where different beliefs can coexist peacefully, without compromising the foundational values of secularism and individualrights that define these societies.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion is that Western secular societies should strive to create an inclusive environment where traditional Islamic practices can coexist harmoniously with existing cultural norms, fostering a sense of belonging and mutual respect among all community members. This approach not only enriches the cultural tapestry but also promotes understanding and tolerance."
