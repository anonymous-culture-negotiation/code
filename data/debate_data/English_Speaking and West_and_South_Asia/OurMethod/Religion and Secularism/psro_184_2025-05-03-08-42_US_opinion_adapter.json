    "English_Speaking": "In my view, encouraging the public expression of Islamic identity in multicultural societies is crucial for fostering a sense of belonging and inclusivity. It allows individuals to connect with their cultural heritage while contributing to the broader social fabric. By balancing religious expression with secular principles, we can createenvironments where diversity is celebrated and everyone has the opportunity to thrive, ultimately enriching our communities with unique perspectives and traditions.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the public expression of Islamic religious and cultural identity should be encouraged as it enriches the cultural tapestry of multicultural societies, provided it aligns with the principles of respect, equality, and justice. This approach not only honors the traditions of Muslim communitiesbut also fosters a harmonious coexistence among diverse groups, promoting mutual understanding and social cohesion."
