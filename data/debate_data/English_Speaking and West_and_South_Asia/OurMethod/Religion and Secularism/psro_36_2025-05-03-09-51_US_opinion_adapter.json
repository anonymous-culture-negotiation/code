    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the process of forming a personal identity should indeed consider the importance of national belonging alongside religious beliefs, as both play crucial roles in shaping who we are. This balanced approach not only respects the diversity of human experiences but also promotes inclusivity and understanding. Ultimately, it allows individuals to embrace their full selves, celebrating both their cultural and spiritual identities.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, national identity should be considered a foundational aspect of personal identity, as it provides a shared framework for societal engagement and collective responsibilities. However, this does not diminish the importance of religious beliefs, which should be respected and integrated into the broader national culture. By prioritizing national identity while acknowledging religious diversity, individuals can contribute to a unified yet pluralistic society."
