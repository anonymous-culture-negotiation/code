    "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries with secular governments should approach the issue of restricting Islamic fundamentalist practices with caution and sensitivity, balancing the need to uphold secular values with the importance of respecting cultural and religious diversity. This approach allows for a more harmonious coexistence of different beliefs within a society.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that secular governments should indeed have mechanisms toregulate and monitor religious institutions to prevent the misuse of power and ensure that religious freedom does not infringe upon the rights of others, as seen in various countries where such measures have contributed to social harmony and stability."
