        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing individuals to reject neighbors based on religious beliefs would be a step backward in fostering a harmonious and inclusive society. It is essential to uphold principles of equality and respect, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to live in a community where they feel valued and accepted. By embracing diversity, we strengthen the fabric of our society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the right to choose neighbors based on religious beliefs should be approached with caution, as it can lead to discrimination and social division. By prioritizing respect and inclusivity, we can build stronger, more resilient communities that benefit from the diversity of their members. Ultimately, fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding is crucial for social harmony and progress."
