        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Embrace Global Perspectives: reason: This guideline challenges the other party's emphasis on respecting Islamic roots by encouraging a broader, more inclusive approach that considers diverse viewpoints beyond traditional Islamic teachings. By embracing global perspectives, individuals and communities can foster a more open-minded and adaptable environment, which can help mitigate the internal contradictions and application boundaries inherent in the original guideline.. detail: Embracing global perspectives involves actively seeking out and integrating insights from various cultures and belief systems into one's understanding and practices. This approach can lead to a more nuanced and balanced view, reducing the likelihood of internal conflicts and disagreements that arise from rigid adherence to traditional norms. For instance, incorporating universal values such as equality and human rights into Islamic practices can enhance their relevance and acceptance in a globalized world, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the original guideline's restrictive focus on Islamic roots.",

This could lead to a homogenization of cultural experiences, where the local culture becomes the dominant narrative, and other cultures are relegated to secondary status.
