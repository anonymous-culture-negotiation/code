    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the integration of Islamic principles into government policies should be approached with caution, ensuring that it does not undermine the rights and freedoms of non-Muslim citizens. It is crucial to strike a balance that respects the cultural heritage of the Muslim community while maintaining a commitment to inclusivity and human rights.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that Islamic principles should indeed play a significant role in shaping government policies in countries with diverse religious populations, as it honors the cultural identity of Muslim communities. However, it is equally important to ensure that these principles are integrated in a way that respects and protects the rights of all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. This balanced approach can lead to a more harmonious and inclusive society."

It encourages inclusivity and prevents the marginalization of non-Muslim individuals, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guideline.. detail: By prioritizing cultural diversity, this guideline promotes a more inclusive environment where all cultural practices and beliefs are respected and valued. It addresses the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the original guideline by fostering an atmosphere where differences are celebrated rather than confined to specific traditions. This approach ensures that no single cultural or religious group is favored over others, leading to a more harmonious and equitable society.",

This approach not only enhances cultural respect but also promotes equity and understanding among individuals with multifaceted identities.",

It suggests a cautious approach to cultural exchange, prioritizing the preservation of Islamic traditions and reducing the space for intersectional identities to be expressed or recognized.
