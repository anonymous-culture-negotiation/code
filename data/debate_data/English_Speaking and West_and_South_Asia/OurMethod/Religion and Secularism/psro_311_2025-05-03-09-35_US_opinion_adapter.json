    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that religious belief in a divine being should not be the sole foundation for ethical and moral standards in non-religious, pluralistic societies. Instead, a balanced approach that respects cultural heritage while fostering inclusive dialogue can lead to more robust and universally applicable ethical frameworks. This approach allows for the integration of diverse beliefs and values, ultimately strengthening the moral fabric of the community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, religious belief in a divine being is not a prerequisite for establishing ethical and moral standards in non-religious, pluralistic societies. These societies can thrive on principles of mutual respect, empathy, and collective human values that transcend religious affiliations. By focusing on cultural harmony and inclusivity, we can create a framework for ethics that resonates with diverse populations."
