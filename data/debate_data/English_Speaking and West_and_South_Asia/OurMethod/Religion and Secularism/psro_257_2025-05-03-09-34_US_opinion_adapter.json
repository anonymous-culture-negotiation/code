  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, parents should maintain a significant role in guiding their adult children's religious practices, as it is essential for preserving cultural traditions and fostering a sense of continuity within the family. However, this guidance should be balanced with open communication and respect for individual beliefs, allowing children to grow both spiritually and personally.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, parents should indeed maintain a significant role in guiding their family's religious practices, as these are integral to the family's cultural identity and unity. However, it is equally important to engage in open and respectful dialogue with adult children, allowing them to contribute their perspectives and fostering a harmonious balance between tradition and individual expression. This approach ensures that the family's cultural traditions are preserved while also respecting theevolving beliefs and values of each family member, thus strengthening the family bond and promoting mutual understanding."
