        "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Cultural Norms, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the significance of cultural heritage in shaping individual behavior, providing a foundation for moral and ethical standards that are deeply ingrained in societal values.. Respecting cultural norms means recognizing the importance of traditional beliefs and practices that have been passed down through generations, which often include specific views on premarital sexual activity. These norms are not merely rules but reflections of collective wisdom and community values that guide individuals in making choices that align with their cultural identity. They offer a sense of belonging and continuity, reinforcing the idea that personal decisions should consider the broader social context.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural traditions and personal autonomy should be balanced, allowing individuals to make choices that reflect their own values while respecting the broader cultural context. This balance is crucial for maintaining social cohesion and individual freedom."
