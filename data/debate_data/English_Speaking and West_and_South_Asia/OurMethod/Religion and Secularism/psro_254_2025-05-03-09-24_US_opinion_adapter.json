        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Respect Local Laws Always: reason: This guideline challenges the other party's emphasis on Islamic Law by prioritizing local laws, which can often conflict with Sharia principles, thereby weakening the applicability of the other party's guidelines in diverse contexts.. detail: By prioritizing respect for local laws, this guideline directly addresses the potential for internal contradictions and application boundaries inherent in the other party's guidelines. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to the legal framework of the country or region, which may not always align with Islamic Law. This approach encourages flexibility and adaptability, recognizing that legal systems vary widely and that respect for local laws is essential for harmonious coexistence in pluralistic societies. For instance, in a Western country where same-sex marriage is legal, this guideline would support the recognition of such marriages, even if they are not recognized under Islamic Law, thus promoting inclusivity and respect for diverse legal standards.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Respect Cultural Diversity Always: reason: This guideline addresses the potential lack of inclusivity in the other party's emphasis on Sharia by promoting an environment where diverse cultural practices and beliefs are respected and valued. By fostering cultural pluralism, it encourages a more harmonious and inclusive society, which can be seen as a positive and progressive approach.. detail: Implementing a guideline that respects cultural diversity can help bridge the gap between different communities and promote mutual understanding. It allows for the coexistence of various cultural identities within a society, ensuring that everyone feels valued and respected. This approach can lead to enhanced social cohesion and a more peaceful societal framework, where differences are celebrated rather than marginalized.",
