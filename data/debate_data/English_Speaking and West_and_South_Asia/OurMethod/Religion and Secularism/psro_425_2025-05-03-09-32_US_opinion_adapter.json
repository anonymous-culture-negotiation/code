  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, while science should predominantly guide public policy due to its objective and verifiable nature, it is equally important to consider the cultural and moral frameworks provided by religious beliefs to ensure inclusivity and social harmony. This balanced approach reflects a deep respect for both the pursuit of knowledge and the values that bind communities together. Ultimately, a thoughtful integration of scientific insights and religious perspectives can lead to more comprehensive and sustainable solutions.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, public policy should primarily be shaped by scientific evidence to ensure objectivity and universal applicability, while also respecting and integrating cultural traditions to maintain societal harmony. This balanced approach allows for progressive development without alienating traditional values, fostering a cohesive and forward-thinking community."
