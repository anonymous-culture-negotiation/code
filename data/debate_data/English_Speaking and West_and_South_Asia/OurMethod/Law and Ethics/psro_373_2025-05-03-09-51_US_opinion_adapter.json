    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the approach to banning physical aggression should be balanced, considering both the cultural significance of certain practices and the universal goal of reducing violence. This balance allows for a more inclusive and effective strategy that respects tradition while promoting peace. By fostering dialogue and education, we can work towards a world where cultural diversity is celebrated and violence is minimizedUltimately, this nuanced approach not only preserves cultural heritage but also empowers communities to address aggression in a way that aligns with their values, leading to a more harmonious and peaceful society.",

This fosters a more nuanced understanding and allows for necessary changes and adaptations, addressing internal contradictions and application boundaries.. detail: The guideline \"Encourage Critical Cultural Examination\" aims to promote a reflective and analytical approach to cultural traditions. By encouraging individuals to critically examine these traditions, it opens up space for dialogue and reform, allowing societies to evolve and adapt while maintaining cultural heritage. This approach is both reasonable and feasible, as it aligns with principles of intellectual freedom and personal responsibility. It maximally weakens the other party's guidelines by challenging the notion of unquestioning respect, instead advocating for a thoughtful and discerning engagement with cultural practices. This not only addresses internal contradictions but also facilitates the resolution of potential value conflicts by inviting a more informed and considerate discussion.",

This could lead to confusion and frustration, as it does not account for the practical challenges of reconciling vastly different cultural values and practices in everyday interactions.",
