    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the belief that democratic governments should not engage in covert surveillance without explicit consent from citizens, as it fundamentally clashes with the values of transparency and accountability that are central to democratic governance. The potential for misuse and the chilling effect on free speech and association are significant concerns that outweigh the benefits of such measures. Ultimately, maintaining public trust and upholding human rights should be the cornerstone of any national security strategy.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, democratic governments should not engage in covert surveillance without robust checks and balances, as it undermines the trust and respect that are foundational to a healthy democracy. The guidelines of protecting privacy and limiting surveillance are essential in maintaining this delicate balance, ensuring that national security measures do not infringe upon the fundamental rights of citizens."
