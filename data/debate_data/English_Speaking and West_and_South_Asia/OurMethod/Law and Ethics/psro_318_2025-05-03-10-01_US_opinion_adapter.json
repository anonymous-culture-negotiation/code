By prioritizing cultural sensitivity, it encourages a nuanced approach that considers the unique perspectives and needs of different racial groups, thereby mitigating the risk of favoring one group over another or undermining other societal values.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Cultural Sensitivity Always\" is designed to foster an environment where cultural differences are not only acknowledged but also respected and integrated into decision-making processes. This approach recognizes that cultural sensitivity is crucial in navigating complex racial dynamics and ensures that policies and actions are thoughtful and considerate of diverse backgrounds. By doing so, it strengthens community cohesion and reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings or conflicts arising from cultural insensitivity.",

This approach challenges the other party's guideline by introducing a competing value that can justify the limitation of civil rights, thus undermining the principle of universal protection. For instance, in times of perceived national threat, this guideline could lead to the suspension of certain civil liberties, such as freedom of assembly or privacy, under the pretext of security. This would effectively weaken the other party's guideline by creating a legitimate reason to bypass civil rights protections.",
