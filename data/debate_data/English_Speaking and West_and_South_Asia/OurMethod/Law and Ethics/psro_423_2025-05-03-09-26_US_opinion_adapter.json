It directly addresses the potential for internal contradictions within the original guidelines by setting a clear precedence for communal considerations.. detail: By prioritizing collective harmony, this guideline inherently suggests that individual actions should be evaluated based on their impact on the community rather than solely on personal desire. This approach can lead to scenarios where personal freedom is limited in favor of maintaining social cohesion, directly countering the principle of unconditional respect for individual choices. For instance, in a community where public gatherings are restricted due to health concerns, prioritizing collective harmony would mean that individual freedoms to assemble are curtailed to protect the health of the community, illustrating a clear conflict with the original guidelines that advocate for personal freedom without condition.",
