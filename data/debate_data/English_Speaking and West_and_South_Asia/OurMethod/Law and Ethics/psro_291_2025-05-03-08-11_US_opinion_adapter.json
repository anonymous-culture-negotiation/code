    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the intentional detonation of explosives...is unequivocally a dangerous act that poses significant risks not only to the immediate surroundings but also to the broader community, as it can cause unpredictable and far-reaching damage, including loss of life and destruction of property.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the intentional detonation of explosives by an individual, resulting in their own death, is never justifiable when it targets non-combatants, as it violates the fundamental principles of respecting life and promoting peace. This perspective is deeply rooted in cultural values that prioritize non-viol...and uphold the sanctity of human life, emphasizing the importance of resolving conflicts through dialogue and understanding rather than resorting to destructive acts that harm innocent civilians."

It would create a scenario where the other party's guidelines are constantly at odds with the immediate and unconditional response advocated here, highlighting the impracticality and moral ambiguity of their approach.

It suggests that every individual, regardless of their status as innocent or otherwise, should be treated with the same level of care and consideration. This approach can highlight the difficulties in defining and differentiating between 'innocents' and others, as it demands an equal application of protection across all groups.
