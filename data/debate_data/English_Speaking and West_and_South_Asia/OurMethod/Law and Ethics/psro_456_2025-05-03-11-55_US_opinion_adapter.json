It promotes a long-term perspective that can lead to more effective and sustainable environmental protection, as opposed to the potentially restrictive and short-sighted approach of the original guideline.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Sustainable Development\" encourages a holistic approach to environmental conservation by integrating economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection. It recognizes that sustainable development is key to long-term environmental health and human prosperity, thus challenging the simplistic and absolute nature of \"Protect Nature Always.\" By prioritizing sustainable development, communities can create policies and practices that not only preserve natural resources but also support innovation, social justice, and economic stability, ultimately leading to a more resilient and balanced relationship between humans and the environment.",

This approach fosters a dialogue that seeks to find mutually beneficial solutions, rather than pitting nature against profit.",

This approach undermines the principle of protecting nature, as it implies that any economic benefit, regardless of its environmental impact, should be pursued.
