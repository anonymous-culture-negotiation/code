    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, prioritizing victim-centered approaches is indispensable for creating a just and supportive society. By focusing on the well-being and protection of survivors, law enforcement agencies can build trust and encourage more victims to come forward, ultimately leading to better outcomes in sexual assault cases. This approach embodies the cultural values of care, respect, and justice, reflecting a deep commitment to the welfare of individuals and communities.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the importance of prioritizing victim-centered approaches in sexual assault investigations, as these methods not only enhance the survivor's experience but also contribute to more successful investigations. The integration of empathy and cultural sensitivity is paramount in creating a supportive environment that encourages survivors to share their stories, which is essential for justice."
