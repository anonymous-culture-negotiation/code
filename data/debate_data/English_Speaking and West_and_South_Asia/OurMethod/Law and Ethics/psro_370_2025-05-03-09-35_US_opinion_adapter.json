    "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing racial discrimination in housing contradicts fundamental values of equality and respect for human rights. It undermines the social fabric by creating divisions and fostering an environment of exclusion and hostility. By rejecting such practices, we can work towards a more harmonious and equitable society.",

This approach can lead to a lack of representation and opportunities for diverse groups, reinforcing existing biases and stereotypes. Furthermore, it may create an environment where cultural expressions are limited to those that align with the dominant group, potentially stifling creativity and innovation that come from diverse perspectives.",
