  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the imposition of more severe penalties for convicted rapists in India is a necessary step towards creating a safer society for women, reflecting a commitment to justice and accountability. This approach is deeplyrooted in the belief that such measures not only serve as a deterrent but also underscore the societal condemnation of sexual violence, aligning with the broader goal of fostering a culture of respect and equality.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the imposition of harsher penalties for rapists in countries like India is a necessary step towards justice and deterrence, reflecting deep-rooted cultural values that prioritize the safety and dignity of women. This approach must be balanced with cultural sensitivity to ensure that the measures resonate with the community and are effective in reducing sexual violence."

        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Implement Evidence-Based Sentencing: reason: Effectively counters the challenges of application boundaries and value conflicts by relying on empirical evidence to guide sentencing decisions, ensuring consistency and fairness.. detail: This guideline advocates for the use of evidence-based practices in sentencing, which helps to mitigate the subjective nature of determining penalties. By relying on data and research, the application of penalties becomes more standardized and less prone to inconsistencies. This approach also helps to address value conflicts by grounding decisions in objective criteria rather than emotional or political pressures, thereby enhancing public trust in the judicial system and reducing potential social unrest.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Implement Contextual Justice Practices: reason: Challenges the application boundaries by considering socioeconomic factors, mental health issues, and systemic injustices, ensuring that justice is served in a manner that is fair and equitable for all individuals.. detail: This guideline advocates for a justice system that takes into account the unique circumstances and challenges faced by different individuals and communities. By integrating contextual considerations into legal proceedings, the system can better address the complexities of crime and punishment, reducing the risk of disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. This approach promotes fairness, equity, and understanding, weakening the argument for blanket harsh penalties that do not account for individual contexts. It encourages a more nuanced and empathetic approach to justice, one that seeks to heal and restore rather than simply punish.",
