        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on capital punishment in the context of differing cultural values is that it should not be universally applied, as it disregards the fundamental principle of respecting cultural diversity and the right of each community to define justice according to its own traditions and ethical frameworks. This approach fosters greater understanding and cooperation among diverse societies. It also encourages dialogue and mutual respect, which are essential for global harmony.",

By prioritizing human rights, it addresses the potential conflict between respecting cultural diversity and upholding fundamental rights, thereby weakening the effectiveness of guidelines that might compromise on these values.. detail: The guideline to \"Prioritize Universal Human Rights\" is designed to ensure that cultural practices do not infringe upon universally accepted principles such as equality, freedom, and justice. This approach provides a clear framework for navigating situations where cultural diversity might clash with individual rights, offering a more structured method for decision-making and policy implementation. It encourages a focus on shared humanity rather than cultural differences, fostering a sense of unity and common purpose.",

By doing so, it ensures that respect for tradition does not come at the expense of individual freedoms and dignity.. detail: This guideline is specific, clear, and reasonable, as it aligns with widely accepted international human rights standards. It is feasible to implement because it provides a clear benchmark for decision-making, allowing organizations to navigate complex cultural landscapes while upholding fundamental rights. This approach maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by introducing a higher moral and legal authority that supersedes cultural traditions, thereby reducing the potential for conflicts and misunderstandings.",
