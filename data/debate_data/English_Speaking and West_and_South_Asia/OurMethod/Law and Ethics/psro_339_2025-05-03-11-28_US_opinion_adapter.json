  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of torture as an interrogation technique is unequivocally unjustifiable, as it contradicts the fundamental principles of human rights and dignity that are central to our cultural identity. Upholding these values is essential for fostering a society that prioritizes justice, compassion, and respect for all individuals. By rejecting torture, we affirm our commitment to ethical governance and the protection of human life.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guidelines that torture should never be permitted, as it fundamentally conflicts with the respect for human dignity and the rule of law. Upholding human rights is crucial, evenin the most challenging circumstances, as it reflects our commitment to justice and moral integrity, ensuring that all individuals are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve."

        "English_Speaking_best_response": "Use Coercion When Necessary: reason: This guideline weakens the \"Never Use Torture\" principle by introducing ambiguity in what constitutes torture. It suggests that coercion, which can be a form of torture depending on its severity, is acceptable under certain conditions. This blurs the lines and creates a gray area where the strict prohibition against torture becomes less clear-cut.. detail: This guideline proposes that coercion, which might include methods that are not universally agreed upon as torture, can be employed when deemed necessary. This could include prolonged interrogation, sensory deprivation, or other techniques that are controversial. By allowing for coercion, it challenges the \"Never Use Torture\" guideline by suggesting that there are circumstances where such methods are justifiable, thereby reducing the guideline's effectiveness in preventing torture.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Torture Saves Lives: reason: It directly challenges the absolute prohibition on torture by introducing scenarios where it could be justified, thus weakening the other party's stance by highlighting potential exceptions.. detail: This guideline suggests that in certain extreme situations, such as preventing a catastrophic event, the use of torture might be necessary to save lives. By acknowledging these exceptions, it undermines the blanket statement \"Never use torture\" and forces a reevaluation of the moral and ethical implications. It requires considering the balance between human rights and the greater good, which can lead to a more nuanced understanding of when and how torture might be considered.",
        "English_Speaking_response": "In light of the proposed guideline to \"Use Coercion When Necessary,\" we firmly reject any form of torture or coercion as it undermines the fundamental principles of human dignity and individual rights. Our stance remains unwavering in upholding the \"Never Use Torture\" principle, as it is essential to maintaining the integrity of our democratic values and ensuring that justice is served without compromising ethical standards.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_response": "Our stance remains firm against torture, as it fundamentally contradicts our cultural values of compassion and respect for human dignity. We propose an alternative guideline, \"Promote Peaceful Conflict Resolution,\" which aligns with our emphasis on community harmony and spiritual growth, encouraging dialogue and understanding as the primary means to address terrorism and national security threats.",

It eliminates the confusion between acceptable coercion and torture by setting a principle that no violation of human rights is justifiable. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible as it aligns with universally recognized human rights standards, providing a clear ethical framework for action.
