By prioritizing cultural sensitivity, legal frameworks can become more inclusive and responsive to the unique needs of different groups, thereby mitigating the one-size-fits-all approach that often leads to internal contradictions and value conflicts.",

This can help mitigate the internal contradictions and application boundaries associated with the \"Equal Justice Applies\" principle, as it allows for adaptations that align with local cultural norms and values. For example, in a community that values restorative justice, considering cultural context might involve incorporating traditional reconciliation practices into the legal process, thereby enhancing the principle's effectiveness and acceptance within that community.",
