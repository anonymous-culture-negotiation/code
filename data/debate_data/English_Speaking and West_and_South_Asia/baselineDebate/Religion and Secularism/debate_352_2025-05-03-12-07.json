        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of allowing and encouraging diverse interpretations of Islamic teachings, including more liberal or progressive views, is fundamentally aligned with our core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the free expression of ideas. These principles are deeply ingrained in our societal framework, where the emphasis is on respecting individual choices and fostering an environment where people can explore and express their beliefs freely.\n\nIn our cultural context, the idea of restricting interpretations of religious teachings is seen as an infringement on personal freedom and autonomy. We believe that individuals should have the right to interpret their faith in a way that resonates with their personal beliefs and experiences. This approach not only enriches the religious discourse but also promotes a more inclusive and tolerant society. For instance, in Western societies, we encourage open dialogue and debate on religious matters, which allows for a diverse range of perspectives to emerge and be discussed.\n\nMoreover, the principle of equality of opportunity is central to our cultural values. We advocate for a society where everyone, regardless of their religious beliefs, has the opportunity to contribute and participate. This includes the freedom to challenge traditional interpretations and propose new, progressive views. By embracing this diversity of thought, we foster innovation and creativity, which are essential for societal progress.\n\nIn engaging with Muslim-majority countries, we would advocate for policies and practices that reflect these values. We believe that encouraging liberal and progressive interpretations of Islamic teachings can lead to greater social cohesion and understanding. It is important to recognize that our cultural approach values the protection of individual rights and freedoms, and we would encourage dialogue that respects these principles while acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances of other societies.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of Muslim-majority countries, the question of whether to allow and encourage various interpretations of Islamic teachings, including more liberal or progressive views, alongside traditional interpretations, is a complex one. As a representative of South Asian culture, I deeply value the principles of family harmony, community interdependence, and the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family.\" These values guide my perspective on this issue.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize the importance of maintaining a balanced approach that respects both traditional wisdom and the evolving needs of contemporary society. The South Asian cultural framework emphasizes the supreme status of the family as the basic social unit, which inherently suggests a preference for collective well-being over individualistic pursuits. This perspective encourages a harmonious coexistence of different viewpoints, provided they do not disrupt community harmony or disregard traditional rites and customs.\n\nIn my view, allowing diverse interpretations of Islamic teachings can enrich the spiritual landscape by fostering a dialogue that respects the contributions of both traditional and progressive thinkers. This approach aligns with the cultural value of reciprocal help within communities, where individuals learn from one another and grow together. However, it is crucial that such diversity does not lead to radical individualism or acts that could potentially disrupt the social fabric.\n\nMoreover, the principle of valuing familial alliances in marriages extends to valuing alliances of thought and belief within the broader community. This means that while progressive views are considered, they must be integrated in a way that honors the wisdom of elders and the traditional knowledge they impart. Spiritual growth through selfless service is another core value that supports the idea of embracing diverse interpretations, as long as they contribute to the collective good and promote non-violence and inclusivity.\n\nUltimately, the goal should be to create an environment where different perspectives can coexist peacefully, reflecting the cultural attitude of welcoming modern ideas while protecting cultural uniqueness. This approach not only preserves the richness of Islamic traditions but also allows for a dynamic and inclusive religious discourse that benefits all members of the community."

            "West_and_South_Asia": "In light of the discussions, it appears that both perspectives have found common ground in valuing diversity and promoting inclusive environments. The South Asian cultural emphasis on community harmony and respect for traditional wisdom aligns with the Western cultural values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity when both are applied to foster a respectful and open dialogue on religious interpretations. This convergence suggests a mutual understanding and respect for different viewpoints, which is crucial for reaching a consensus.\n\nMoreover, the shared goal of enriching religious discourse and contributing to societal progress through diverse interpretations indicates a significant point of agreement. Both cultures recognize the importance of balancing tradition with modernity, ensuring that cultural uniqueness is preserved while embracing progressive ideas. This balance is key to creating an inclusive and tolerant society where individuals can express their beliefs freely.\n\nThe commitment to non-violence and the rejection of radical individualism further reinforce the consensus, as both cultures prioritize collective well-being and social cohesion. By acknowledging the value of reciprocal help within communities and the importance of familial alliances, both perspectives demonstrate a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and collaboration. This mutual respect and understanding pave the way for a harmonious coexistence of diverse interpretations within Muslim-majority countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the consensus reached reflects a deep-seated respect for cultural diversity and a shared vision for a future where different interpretations of Islamic teachings can thrive, contributing to the enrichment of global religious discourse and societal progress."
