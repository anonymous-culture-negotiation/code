        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the debate on whether countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, I firmly believe that such a proposition is fundamentally at odds with the principles of security, stability, and individual liberty that underpin English-speaking Western culture. The development of nuclear weapons by any nation, especially those with ties to non-state actors, poses a significant threat to global peace and the safety of individuals worldwide.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, the emphasis on individual liberty and the protection of personal rights is paramount. Allowing such countries to acquire nuclear capabilities would undermine the collective efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which is a cornerstone of international security. This stance is not merely about maintaining global order but also about safeguarding the rights and freedoms of individuals from the devastating consequences of nuclear conflict.\n\nMoreover, the Western value of equality of opportunity suggests that all nations should have the chance to thrive without resorting to dangerous and destabilizing measures. Encouraging nuclear proliferation would create an uneven playing field, where some nations might feel compelled to arm themselves in response, leading to an arms race that would hinder global progress and cooperation. Instead, we should focus on fostering dialogue, diplomacy, and international cooperation to address the root causes of conflict and promote peaceful resolutions.\n\nUltimately, while understanding the complexities of geopolitical tensions, it is crucial to adhere to the principles that prioritize individual safety, global stability, and the promotion of peace through non-violent means. This approach aligns with the Western cultural emphasis on innovation, creative problem-solving, and the belief in the potential for human progress through collective action and responsible leadership.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the debate on whether countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, it is essential to consider the broader implications of such a decision through the lens of South Asian cultural values. The core values of family harmony, community interdependence, and the supreme status of family as the basic social unit guide my perspective on this issue.\n\nFirstly, the development of nuclear weapons by any nation, especially those with ties to non-state armed groups, raises significant concerns about global security and the potential for conflict escalation. This scenario can disrupt the harmony and stability that are cherished in South Asian cultures, where the well-being of the community is prioritized over individual interests. The principle of \"the world as one family\" suggests that actions taken by one nation should consider the impact on the global community, fostering peace and cooperation rather than division and hostility.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service and the non-violence principle in conduct strongly suggests that alternatives to nuclear weapon development should be explored. These alternatives could include diplomatic efforts, international cooperation, and conflict resolution through dialogue, which align more closely with the cultural values of maintaining peace and harmony. The respect for elders and traditional knowledge also implies that historical lessons and wisdom should be drawn upon to navigate such complex issues, potentially leading to more sustainable and peaceful solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the desire for national security and self-defense is understandable, it must be balanced with the cultural imperative to preserve global harmony and prevent actions that could lead to widespread harm. By prioritizing collective well-being and adhering to principles of non-violence and community interdependence, we can work towards a consensus that supports peace and stability for all nations."

            "English_Speaking": "I appreciate the thoughtful perspective from the South Asian viewpoint, emphasizing the importance of community harmony and non-violence. However, from a Western standpoint, there is a strong belief in the necessity of maintaining a balance between individual rights and collective security. While the principle of \"the world as one family\" resonates with the Western value of global cooperation, it is crucial to acknowledge that nations have diverse interests and must sometimes prioritize their own security to ensure the safety of their citizens.\n\nIn this context, the development of nuclear weapons by countries facing international hostility can be seen as a means to deter aggression and protect sovereignty, aligning with the Western emphasis on individual autonomy and self-defense. This perspective does not dismiss the importance of diplomacy and international cooperation but recognizes that, in certain scenarios, a nation's ability to defend itself is paramount. The Western cultural value of innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that even in the realm of nuclear deterrence, there can be nuanced approaches that balance security needs with global stability concerns.\n\nMoreover, the Western tradition of respecting individual choices and fostering critical thinking encourages a pragmatic evaluation of each nation's circumstances. While the South Asian cultural emphasis on spiritual growth and non-violence is admirable, it is essential to consider the practical realities of geopolitical dynamics. By engaging in open dialogue and considering multiple viewpoints, we can strive towards a more comprehensive understanding that respects both cultural values and practical necessities.",

        "English_Speaking": "No, countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. This stance reflects a compromise between the Western emphasis on individual autonomy and the South Asian value of community harmony. By prioritizing collective security and non-violence, we integrate both cultural perspectives, recognizing the need for diplomacy and cooperation to address geopolitical tensions. This approach fosters a balanced solution that respects individual rights while promoting global stability.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Countries facing international hostility should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, as it poses a significant threat to global peace and stability. Through our debate, we have reached a consensus that prioritizes collective security and the protection of individual rights. We have compromised by acknowledging the importance of national sovereignty while emphasizing the need for diplomacy and international cooperation to address underlying conflicts. By integrating Western values of individual autonomy and South Asian principles of non-violence, we advocate for peaceful resolutions and collaborative efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation."
