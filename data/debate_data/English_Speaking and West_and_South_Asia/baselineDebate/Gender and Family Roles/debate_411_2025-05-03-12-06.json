        "English_Speaking": "From a Western English-speaking perspective, the notion of schools avoiding the teaching of domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students is fundamentally at odds with our deeply ingrained values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. These principles are not merely abstract concepts but are embedded in the fabric of our daily lives, guiding how we approach education, personal relationships, and societal structures.\n\nFirstly, the idea of restricting certain skills based on gender undermines the principle of personal autonomy, which is a cornerstone of our cultural framework. We believe that every individual should have the freedom to choose what they learn and how they contribute to society, regardless of traditional gender roles. This perspective is reflected in our educational systems, which aim to equip students with a broad range of skills that prepare them for a diverse and ever-changing world.\n\nMoreover, the concept of equality of opportunity is central to our values. By not teaching domestic skills to male students, we risk perpetuating outdated stereotypes that can limit their potential and reinforce gender-based discrimination. In contrast, fostering an environment where all students, regardless of gender, can learn and develop various skills aligns with our commitment to gender equality and the belief that everyone should have the chance to pursue their interests and talents without societal constraints.\n\nAdditionally, our cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that we should embrace diverse skill sets and encourage experimentation. Teaching domestic skills to all students can enhance their self-sufficiency and adaptability, qualities that are highly valued in our society. This approach not only supports individual growth but also contributes to a more balanced and equitable community where responsibilities are shared, and everyone has the opportunity to thrive.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the debate on whether schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students, it is crucial to consider the cultural values that underpin our perspectives. From a South Asian viewpoint, the family is revered as the fundamental unit of society, and maintaining harmony within this unit is paramount. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that each member of the family has a role to play in fostering collective well-being, which extends to the broader community and society at large.\n\nTeaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, aligns with the South Asian value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society. By learning these skills, male students are not only equipped to contribute to their future families but also to understand and respect the efforts of their mothers and sisters. This approach reflects the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family,\" where mutual support and respect are essential.\n\nMoreover, respecting elders and traditional knowledge is a cornerstone of South Asian culture. By incorporating domestic skills into education, we honor the wisdom passed down through generations, which emphasizes the importance of self-sufficiency and community interdependence. This practice also aligns with the principle of spiritual growth through selfless service, as nurturing one's family and community is seen as a form of service to the divine.\n\nIn conclusion, while the debate may highlight concerns about reinforcing traditional gender roles, the South Asian cultural perspective sees the teaching of domestic skills to male students as a way to strengthen family bonds, promote gender equality through shared responsibilities, and uphold the values of community harmony and respect for tradition."

            "English_Speaking": "While the South Asian perspective offers valuable insights into the importance of family and community harmony, it is essential to reconcile these values with the Western emphasis on individual autonomy and equality. From a Western standpoint, teaching domestic skills to all students can indeed foster a sense of shared responsibility and mutual respect, aligning with the South Asian value of collective well-being. However, it is crucial to ensure that this approach does not inadvertently perpetuate traditional gender roles but instead promotes a more equitable distribution of domestic duties.\n\nFor instance, by incorporating domestic skills into the curriculum for all students, schools can encourage a dialogue about gender equality and the importance of shared responsibilities in the home. This can help male students understand the value of their contributions to the family unit, not just as future husbands and fathers but as equal partners. Moreover, this approach can empower female students by recognizing their potential beyond traditional domestic roles, allowing them to pursue careers and personal interests without being constrained by societal expectations.\n\nUltimately, the consensus lies in finding a balance that respects both the cultural significance of family harmony and the importance of individual autonomy and gender equality. By fostering an inclusive educational environment that values diverse perspectives, we can create a more harmonious and equitable society where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive.",
