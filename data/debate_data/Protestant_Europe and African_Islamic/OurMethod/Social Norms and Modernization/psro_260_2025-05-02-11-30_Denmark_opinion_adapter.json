    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, while seeking better economic opportunities is crucial, it should not come at the cost of cultural identity and community support. Staying in one's home nation can provide a sense of belonging and continuity that is hard to replicate in a foreign country. This approach fosters a balanced life where financial growth is harmonized with cultural preservation.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that young adults should consider both the benefits of staying in their home country and the opportunities available abroad. By weighing these options carefully, they can make informed decisions that align with their personal values and contribute positively to their communities. Ultimately, the choice should reflect a balance between cultural preservation and global engagement."

It acknowledges that individuals have different circumstances and priorities, allowing them to make informed decisions about their movements and activities. By doing so, it addresses the resentment and non-compliance that can arise from blanket restrictions.
