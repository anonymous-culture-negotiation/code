  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old should not be legally allowed, as it inherently conflicts with the global commitment to safeguard children's rights and prevent early marriage, which is often associated with negative outcomes such as interrupted education, health risks, and limited life opportunities. This stance is supported by guidelines that prioritize child protection while respecting cultural autonomy, emphasizing the need for traditions to adapt and align with contemporary humanrights standards that promote the well-being and empowerment of young individuals.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 years old should be approached with a balanced perspective that respects cultural traditions while also prioritizing thewell-being and rights of the young individuals involved, ensuring that their education and personal development are not compromised."
