By doing so, it creates a conflict with the progressive values of equality and diversity, potentially weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that aim to balance heritage with modern identity expressions.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve focusing on maintaining cultural traditions and historical practices without compromising them for the sake of inclusivity. For example, in a cultural context where certain roles are traditionally gender-specific, this guideline would support continuing those practices even if they exclude individuals who identify differently. This approach would likely face resistance from those advocating for inclusivity and could lead to a more divided cultural landscape, highlighting the challenges in reconciling traditional values with contemporary identity expressions.",

It suggests that cultural practices and beliefs should be accepted without any form of critique or analysis, which can stifle progress and prevent necessary adaptations to contemporary values and human rights standards. This approach can lead to the preservation of practices that may be harmful or unjust, simply because they are traditional.
