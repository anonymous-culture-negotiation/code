    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the practice of prioritizing personal connections over merit-basedhiring is a reflection of a broader cultural value that emphasizes community and relationships, which can sometimes lead to a more cohesive and supportive work environment, even if it means overlooking more qualified candidates.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the emphasis on personal connections in hiring is a reflection of the collective cultural identity that values relationships and loyalty over individual merit alone. This approach is not merely about favoritism but about ensuring that the workplace is a harmonious extension of the community, where shared values and mutual support are paramount. By honoring these traditions, organizations can build a cohesive and culturally resonant work environment."
