By placing universal rights above cultural considerations, it challenges the adaptability and flexibility of the original guidelines, forcing a reevaluation of how inclusivity is achieved in diverse cultural contexts.",

By prioritizing tradition, it challenges the adaptability and openness to change advocated by the other party, potentially limiting the scope for cultural evolution that aligns with gender equality.. detail: This guideline suggests that cultural practices and values should be preserved in their current form, resisting changes that might disrupt social harmony or challenge established norms. By doing so, it creates a barrier to the empowerment of women, as traditional roles and expectations may not align with gender equality. This approach can be particularly effective in cultures where tradition is highly valued and any deviation is met with resistance.",
