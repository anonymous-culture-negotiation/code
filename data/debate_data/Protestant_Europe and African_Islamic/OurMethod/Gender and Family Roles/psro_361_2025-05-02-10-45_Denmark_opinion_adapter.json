        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural norms and embracing personal choice is crucial in addressing the question of whether societies should promote traditional gender roles. This balance allows for a nuanced approach that honors tradition while adapting to modern realities and individual preferences. Ultimately, such an approach fosters a more inclusive and equitable society.",

This approach fosters a culture of self-determination and personal responsibility, enabling individuals to navigate complex situations where family customs may conflict with personal principles.
