By stating that traditions should always take precedence, it addresses the issue of unclear application boundaries and potential value conflicts by establishing a definitive hierarchy of values.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve a straightforward approach where all cultural practices and decisions are guided by the principle of upholding tradition. This would mean that any efforts to adapt or modify traditions to accommodate inclusivity would be secondary or even discouraged, ensuring consistency and clarity in cultural practices.
