        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, countries should prioritize policies that promote gender equality while respecting cultural traditions, as this approach fosters inclusivity and sustainability. By balancing progress with heritage, nations can ensure that reforms are not only effective but also embraced by their citizens. This dual focus on equality and tradition can lead to a more harmonious and equitable society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the implementation of policies that promote gender equality should be approached with a deep respect for cultural traditions and a commitment to gradual, inclusive change. This balance allows for the preservation of cultural identity while fostering a society where all genders can participate fully. Ultimately, such an approach ensures that progress is both meaningful and sustainable."

By respecting diversity, it supports a more inclusive society where individuals from different cultural backgrounds feel valued and respected.",

It encourages the active involvement of marginalized voices and the celebration of diverse identities, which helps to address the power imbalances and lack of representation that can occur when cultural heritage is preserved and presented. By fostering inclusive representation, this guideline promotes a more equitable and dynamic view of cultural heritage, acknowledging that cultures are not monolithic but rather composed of various perspectives and experiences. This approach is both reasonable and feasible, as it can be implemented through policy changes, educational curricula, and community initiatives that prioritize diversity and inclusion. It offers a unique advantage by challenging traditional narratives and promoting a more nuanced understanding of cultural heritage, which can be difficult for others to refute due to its alignment with principles of equity and justice.",
