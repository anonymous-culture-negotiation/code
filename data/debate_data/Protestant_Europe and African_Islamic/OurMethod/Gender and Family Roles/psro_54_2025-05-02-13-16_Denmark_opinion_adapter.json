        "Protestant_Europe": "we insist Respect Cultural Norms, the reason is To avoid cultural clashes and ensure a smoother transition towards equality.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of respecting and understanding the cultural context in which gender roles are defined. Implementing laws without considering these norms could lead to resistance and hinder progress. Instead, gradual and culturally sensitive approaches can foster greater acceptance and meaningful change.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the approach to achieving gender equality in societies with deeply ingrained traditional roles should be cautious and respectful. The implementation of laws should consider the cultural context and the potential impact on societal harmony, ensuring that equality is pursued in a way that resonates with the values and traditions of the people. This balanced approach is crucial for sustainable progress and acceptance."
