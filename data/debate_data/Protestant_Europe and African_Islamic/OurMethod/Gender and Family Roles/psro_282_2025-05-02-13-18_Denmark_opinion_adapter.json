    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural norms and empowering personal choice is crucial in addressing the question of women's participation in the workforce. By allowing cultural traditions to guide societal expectations while also recognizing individual autonomy, we can foster a society that values both heritage and equality. This approach ensures that women have the freedomto pursue their professional aspirations without being constrained by rigid cultural expectations, thereby contributing to the overall prosperity and diversity of the community.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect cultural norms, the reason is This guideline is necessary to maintain social harmony and uphold traditional values that have been passed down through generations.. Respecting cultural norms means acknowledging and integrating the long-standing beliefs and practices that define a society's identity, ensuring that any changes or adaptations align with these core principles rather than challenging them abruptly. This approach allows for a gradual and culturally sensitive evolution of gender roles, preserving the essence of cultural heritage while considering contemporary needs."
