  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, employers should never prioritize male candidates over females for high-salary positions, as this practice undermines the principles of gender equality and fairness. The guidelines of equality and merit-based selection are crucial in ensuring that workplaces are inclusive and that opportunities are available to all, regardless of genderBy adhering to these principles, we can foster an environment where individuals are judged on their capabilities and potential, rather than their gender, ultimately leading to a more diverse and successful workforce.",

It is crucial to create a workplace where opportunities are based on merit and skill, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of gender, have an equal chance to succeed. This approach not only aligns with cultural values of equality but also enhances the overall productivity and diversity of the organization."
