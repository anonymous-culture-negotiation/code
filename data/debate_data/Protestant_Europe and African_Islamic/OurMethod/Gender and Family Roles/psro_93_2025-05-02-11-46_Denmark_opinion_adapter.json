    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, universities should strive to maintain admission processes that are free from gender bias, focusing instead on individual merit and cultural sensitivity. This approach not only upholds the principles of equality and fairness but also enriches the educational experience by fostering diversity and inclusivity. By doing so, universities can play a pivotal role in shaping a more equitable society.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that universities should not give preference to one gender over another in their admission processes, as this could lead to unfair treatment and discrimination against individuals who do not fit into the preferred gender category. This approach ensures that all students have an equal chance to succeed based on their abilities and efforts. By maintaining a fair and gender-neutral admission policy, universities can uphold the values of equality and justice, which are deeply rooted in many cultural traditions."

This approach aligns with the value of excellence and efficiency, providing a clear direction that transcends diverse contexts and cultural norms.
