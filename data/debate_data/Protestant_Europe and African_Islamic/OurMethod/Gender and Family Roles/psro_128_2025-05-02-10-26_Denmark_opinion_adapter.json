  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, mandating gender-specific quality of life assessments in national policies is crucial for fostering equality and addressing gender disparities. However, it is essential to approach this mandate with sensitivity to cultural diversity and a strong commitment to human rights. By doing so, governments can create policies that are both effective and respectful of different cultural traditions.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the inclusion of gender-specific quality of life assessments in national policies is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of cultural traditions...and the nuanced understanding of Islamic values, which often emphasize the importance of family and community cohesion, and how these can be balanced with the evolving roles of women in modern society."

For example, if a culture has norms that restrict the freedom of certain groups, this guideline would support those restrictions, even if they violate universally recognized human rights.
