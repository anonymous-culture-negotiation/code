    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, while cultural traditions are important, they should not override the fundamentalprinciples of equality and justice that are central to many Protestant teachings, which emphasize individual conscience and moral integrity.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural traditions and personal autonomy are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of a harmonious society. The guidelines of respecting tradition and empowering women provide a balanced approach, allowing for the preservation of cultural identity while also honoring individual rights and freedoms. This balance is crucial for fostering a society that values both its heritage and the aspirations of its members."

By suggesting that certain practices should be ignored, it forces a conversation about the limits of cultural respect and the need for a more nuanced approach that balances tradition with modern values.
