  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the idea of legally obligating married couples to share their real-time location with each other is not only an infringement on personal privacy but also undermines the trust that is essential for a healthy marriage. By focusing on building trust and respecting each other's autonomy, couples can cultivate a deeperand more meaningful connection, rather than relying on legal mandates that could potentially create resentment and mistrust.",
