    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, Islamic religious and cultural practices are not universally disrespectful of women's rights, as there are numerous examples of Muslim-majority societies that have madesignificant strides in promoting gender equality and empowering women, such as Turkey's secular reforms and the growing number of female leaders in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.",

This approach helps mitigate the risk of unintended special treatment and fosters an environment where everyone is held to the same standards, regardless of gender. It promotes fairness and equality, ensuring that respect is earned through actions and not assumed based on gender identity.",
        "African_Islamic_best_response": "Define Respect Through Consensus: reason: This guideline addresses the challenges of implementation and subjective interpretations of respect by suggesting that definitions of respectful behavior should be derived from collective agreement rather than imposed by a few. It weakens the other party's guidelines by introducing a democratic process that can adapt to various cultural contexts, making the guidelines more feasible and reasonable.. detail: By proposing that respect be defined through consensus, this guideline empowers communities to create their own standards of respectful behavior, reflecting their unique cultural and social dynamics. This approach not only enhances the applicability of the guidelines across different settings but also ensures that the definitions of respect are relevant and meaningful to those who will be implementing them. It encourages active participation and ownership, reducing resistance and increasing compliance, as individuals are more likely to adhere to standards they have helped create.",

It suggests that respect for women should be secondary to cultural norms, which could lead to the perpetuation of patriarchal attitudes and the undermining of efforts to promote gender equality.

It suggests that respect should be inherently tied to the roles and responsibilities that individuals fulfill based on their gender, rather than solely on their actions. This approach is designed to preserve cultural integrity and honor the historical significance of gender roles, which can be seen as a direct countermeasure to the other party's guideline that might be perceived as eroding these cultural norms.",
