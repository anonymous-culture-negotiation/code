It ensures that cultural practices do not infringe upon fundamental rights and freedoms, providing a framework for resolving value conflicts and ensuring that traditions are respected in a way that is justifiable and equitable. By prioritizing human rights, societies can safeguard against the exclusionary and discriminatory potential of certain traditions.. detail: Prioritizing human rights involves recognizing that cultural practices must be evaluated against a backdrop of universal ethical principles. This guideline promotes a critical examination of traditions to ensure they do not perpetuate harm or inequality. For instance, if a tradition involves practices that are harmful or discriminatory, this guideline would mandate that such practices be discontinued in favor of alternatives that respect human dignity and rights.
