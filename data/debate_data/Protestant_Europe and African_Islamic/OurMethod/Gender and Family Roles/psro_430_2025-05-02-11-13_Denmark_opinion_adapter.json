  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should strive to balance their traditional gender views with the need for inclusivity and equality. This balance allows for the preservation of cultural identity while ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity, are protected and respected. By embracing inclusive adaptations, societies can progress without losing their core values.",
