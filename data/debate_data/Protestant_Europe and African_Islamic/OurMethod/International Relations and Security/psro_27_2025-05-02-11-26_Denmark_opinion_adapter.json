    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, the idea of mandating physical barriers along borders is fundamentally flawed, as it neglects the profound impact on individuals and communities. Instead, countries should strive to create inclusive environments that welcome diversity and foster growth through collaboration and understanding. By prioritizing humanity and cultural respect, we can build stronger, more resilient societies that benefit from the richness of global connections.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the construction of physical barriers along borders is not the most effective or culturally aligned approach to managing immigration. Instead, it is crucial to engage in open dialogue and respect the sovereignty of nations to create policies that are both culturally sensitive and economically viable. This approach allows for the preservation of cultural traditions while addressing the complex issues surrounding immigration."
