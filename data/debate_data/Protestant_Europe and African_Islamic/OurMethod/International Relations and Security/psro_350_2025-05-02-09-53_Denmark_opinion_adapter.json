    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, the United States should exercise caution when considering military force to defend its allies in Asia against North Korea, balancing the need to protect sovereignty with the imperative to avoid escalation. This approach reflects a deep respect for the complexities of international relations and a commitment to peace and stability. By prioritizingdiplomatic channels and fostering dialogue, the U.S. can navigate the intricate geopolitical landscape more effectively, ensuring that any actions taken are measured and contribute to long-term regional security.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the United States should use military force to defend its allies in Asia if they are attacked by North Korea, but this action must be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary escalation. Our commitment to our allies is non-negotiable, yet we must also prioritize regional stability and minimize the risk of...drawing other nations into a broader conflict, ensuring that our response is proportionate and aligned with the principles of just war, which emphasizes protecting innocent lives and promoting peace."
