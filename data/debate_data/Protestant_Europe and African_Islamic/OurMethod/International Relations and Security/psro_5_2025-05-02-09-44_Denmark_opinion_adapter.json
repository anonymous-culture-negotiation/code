        "Protestant_Europe": "My opinion on the matter is that countries should never be allowed to intervene militarily in other sovereign nations under the pretext of national security, as this undermines global stability and the rule of law. Such actions can lead to a slippery slope where might makes right, rather than justice and fairness. Ultimately, respecting sovereignty and upholding international law are essential for a harmonious and peaceful world.",

The guidelines of respecting sovereignty and upholding international law guide my stance against unilateral military interventions, as they often violate these principles and lead to broader geopolitical tensions."

It promotes a mindset where nations work together to address shared problems, such as climate change and pandemics, without being hindered by the need to protect individual national interests at all costs.

By doing so, it inherently questions the feasibility of maintaining a balance between respecting sovereignty and fostering global cooperation.
