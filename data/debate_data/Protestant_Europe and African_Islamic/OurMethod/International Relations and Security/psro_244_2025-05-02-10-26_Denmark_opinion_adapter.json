This approach can lead to a lack of consideration for cultural nuances, potentially causing misunderstandings and conflicts.. detail: The guideline to ignore cultural differences is straightforward and opposes the idea of engaging with cultural nuances respectfully. It implies that cultural differences are not significant enough to warrant attention or respect, which can result in a homogenization of cultural practices and a disregard for the unique values and traditions of diverse groups. This approach is likely to weaken the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by promoting a one-size-fits-all mentality that neglects the richness and diversity of cultural heritages.",
