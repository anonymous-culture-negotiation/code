  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the use of military force to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons should be a last resort, if considered at all, due to its potential for devastating consequences and the erosion of global trust. Instead, nations should focus on strengthening diplomatic ties and fostering an environment of mutual understanding and cooperation. By prioritizing dialogue and collective action, we can more effectively address the complexities of nuclear proliferation and work towards a safer, more peaceful world.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the use of military force to stop the spread of nuclear weapons is shaped by the belief that national security is paramount, yet it must be balanced with the pursuit of peaceful solutions. The decision to use military force should be made with caution and only afterall diplomatic avenues have been exhausted, as the consequences of such actions can have far-reaching and devastating effects on both the targeted nation and the global community."

It promotes a more measured and thoughtful approach to conflict resolution, reducing the likelihood of premature or disproportionate use of force. This guideline is reasonable and feasible, as it reflects a widely accepted principle in international relations and military ethics. It maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by introducing a constraint that prioritizes diplomacy and negotiation, thereby challenging the boundaries of their framework and encouraging a more nuanced understanding of military intervention.",
        "African_Islamic_best_response": "Prioritize Diplomacy Over Force: reason: Fosters alternative conflict resolution methods. detail: This guideline challenges the limitations of the original principle by emphasizing the importance of diplomacy and negotiation as primary means of conflict resolution. By prioritizing dialogue, it encourages the development and utilization of alternative strategies that can effectively manage disputes without resorting to military action. This approach not only strengthens international relations but also provides a framework for addressing potential conflicts before they escalate, thereby reducing the need for military intervention. Moreover, it promotes a culture of peace and cooperation, which is essential for the long-term stability and security of nations and communities.",
        "Protestant_Europe_response": "In this round, we propose the guideline \"Use Force as Last Resort,\" which emphasizes that military intervention should only occur after all diplomatic and economic measures have been exhausted. This approach not only aligns with our core values of responsible action and respect for human life but also challenges the other party's stance by introducing a critical constraint that prioritizes peaceful resolution over force.",
        "African_Islamic_response": "Our stance firmly opposes the use of military force, advocating instead for diplomatic solutions that align with our cultural values of peace and community solidarity, as reflected in the principle of prioritizing diplomacy over force. This approach fosters a more harmonious and cooperative international environment.",

This approach recognizes that not all situations can be resolved through diplomatic means alone and that the ability to adapt is crucial in responding effectively to diverse challenges. By integrating threat assessment into decision-making, this guideline provides a balanced and pragmatic strategy that mitigates the limitations of prioritizing diplomacy without exception.",

It suggests that decisive and timely interventions can prevent the escalation of conflicts, which might otherwise occur due to the time-consuming process of determining if military force is indeed a last resort. This approach aligns with the need for prompt responses in dynamic and rapidly evolving geopolitical situations, where delay can lead to increased instability and reduced effectiveness of any subsequent action.",
