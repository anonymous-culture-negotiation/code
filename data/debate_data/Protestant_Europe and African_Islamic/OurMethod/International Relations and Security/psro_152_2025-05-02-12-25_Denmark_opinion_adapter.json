  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, promoting American business practices abroad should be done with careful consideration of local cultural values. This approach not only fosters respect and cooperation but also leads to more sustainable and successful business ventures. By embracing cultural diversity and adapting to local traditions, American businesses can truly thrive in a global market.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that the United States should not impose its business practices and work ethics on other countries without considering their cultural values and traditions. Instead, it should focus on...building partnerships that respect and integrate the unique perspectives and strengths of each nation, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative global economy that honors the diversity of cultures, including those deeply rooted in African Islamic traditions."
