  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, nations should never be allowed to launch preemptive military strikes, as this action contradicts fundamental principles of justice and peace. The use of military force without clear evidence of an imminent threat is a dangerous precedent that can lead to endless cycles of violence and retaliation. By adhering to guidelines that prioritize diplomacy and respect for sovereignty, we can foster a more harmonious and secure world.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the concept of launching preemptive military strikes against perceived threats is fundamentally at odds with the cultural values of peace and cooperation that I hold dear. The principles of \"Never Strike First\" and \"Prioritize Diplomacy Always\" serve as crucialguidelines that shape my perspective on conflict resolution, reflecting a deep-seated belief in the importance of dialogue and understanding over aggression."
