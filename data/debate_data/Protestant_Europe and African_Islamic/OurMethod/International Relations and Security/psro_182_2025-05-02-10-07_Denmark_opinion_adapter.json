By prioritizing collective rights, it may lead to scenarios where individual rights are sacrificed for the benefit of the community, further weakening the other party's stance on human rights.. detail: This guideline is crafted to expose the challenges in balancing collective cultural values with individual human rights. In many cultures, collective rights and community well-being are given more importance than individual freedoms. By prioritizing collective rights, this guideline can result in decisions that favor the community's interests over individual human rights, creating a conflict that undermines the principle of always prioritizing human rights. For example, in a community where traditional practices are valued over individual autonomy, this guideline might justify actions that limit individual freedoms in favor of maintaining cultural harmony, thus challenging the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.",
