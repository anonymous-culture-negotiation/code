  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the United States should not bear sole responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico, as this issue is deeply intertwined with complex factors on both sides of the border. Effective solutions require a collaborative approach that respects cultural differences and acknowledges shared responsibilities. By working together, both countries can develop strategies that address the root causes of drug trafficking and violence, leadingto more sustainable and equitable outcomes for all parties involved, ultimately fostering a safer and more prosperous region.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that the United States should acknowledge its role in the drug-related violence in Mexico and work collaboratively with Mexico to address the issue. This shared responsibility and joint effort can lead to more effective solutions and improved relations between the two countries. By recognizing the complexities of the situation and the need for mutual action, both nations can move towards a more peaceful and secure future."
