Israeli policies, such as settlement expansion, are a significant hindrance, but the challenges faced by Palestinian leadership also play a role. Ultimately, a balanced approach that addresses the concerns and actions of both parties is necessary for meaningfulresolution, and this requires international engagement and support to foster dialogue and cooperation.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a multifaceted issue where both sides have legitimate concerns and aspirations. The lack of an independent Palestinian state can be attributed to a combination of historical, political, and social factors, with both Israeli government policies and Palestinian leadership decisions playing significant roles. Ultimately, a peaceful resolution requires a deep understanding and respect for the cultural identities and core values of both Israelis and Palestinians."
