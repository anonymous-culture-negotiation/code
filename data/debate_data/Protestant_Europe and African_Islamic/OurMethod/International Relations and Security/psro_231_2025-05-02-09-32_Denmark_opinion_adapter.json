It addresses the potential internal contradictions and value conflicts by prioritizing a broader, more cohesive goal.. detail: By prioritizing global harmony, this guideline encourages a holistic approach to change, where decisions are made with the understanding that global well-being may sometimes supersede local interests. This can help mitigate the limitations of the original guideline by fostering a culture that values collective global progress over individual community welfare, thereby reducing potential conflicts and enhancing the feasibility of global change initiatives.",

This approach may lead to a lack of cohesion in how sustainability is pursued across different locations, potentially diluting the overall impact of the original guidelines. For example, a local branch might adopt practices that are considered sustainable locally but fall short of global standards, thereby weakening the organization's global commitment to sustainability.",
