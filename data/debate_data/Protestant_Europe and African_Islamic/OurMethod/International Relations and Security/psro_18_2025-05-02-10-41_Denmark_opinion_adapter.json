This guideline helps to clarify the boundaries of what constitutes respectful dialogue by fostering an environment where questions and critiques are welcomed as part of a learning and growth process, rather than seen as threats to cultural identity.",

This approach can be justified by arguing that cultural identity and autonomy are paramount, and external human rights frameworks may not always align with the values and practices of diverse cultures. For example, in a culture where certain gender roles are deeply ingrained, prioritizing these norms might lead to the exclusion of gender equality principles advocated by human rights.
