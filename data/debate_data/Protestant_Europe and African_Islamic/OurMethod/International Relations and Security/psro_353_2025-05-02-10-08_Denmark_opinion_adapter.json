In situations where transparency is essential for accountability, trust, or public safety, this guideline allows for the adjustment of privacy standards. For instance, in governance, transparency is crucial for citizens to hold leaders accountable, and this guideline supports the disclosure of information necessary for public oversight while still protecting sensitive personal data.
