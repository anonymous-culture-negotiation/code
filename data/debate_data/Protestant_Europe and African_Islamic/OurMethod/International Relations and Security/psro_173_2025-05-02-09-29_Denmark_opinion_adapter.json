    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, allowing economic investments from geopolitical rivals poses significant risks to national autonomy and security, outweighing potential benefits such as job creation. It is essential to prioritize domestic interests and protect national sovereignty to maintain cultural integrity and independence. By doing so, a nation can ensure long-term stability and prosperity.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Protect National Interests, the reason is Prioritizing security over economic gains is crucial in maintaining sovereignty.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of safeguarding national interests, especially when dealing with geopolitical rivals. It reflects a cultural value that places national autonomy and security above economic benefits, recognizing that long-term stability and independence are more valuable than short-term financial gains. This perspective is deeply rooted in a tradition that values self-reliance and the protection of cultural identity."
