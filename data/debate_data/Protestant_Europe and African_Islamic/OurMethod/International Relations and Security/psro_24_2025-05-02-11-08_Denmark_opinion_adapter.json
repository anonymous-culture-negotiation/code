  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, while Western foreign policies can certainly impact the economies of Muslim-majority countries, it is crucial to recognize the significant role that internal factors, such as adherence to Islamic values and the effectiveness of economic policies, play in shaping their economic landscapes. By focusing on these internal aspects, we can develop more targeted and culturally appropriate solutionsthat address the unique challenges and opportunities within these countries, rather than solely attributing economic outcomes to external influences.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the economic challenges faced by Muslim-majority countries cannot be solely attributed to Western foreignpolicies, as internal factors such as corruption, lack of infrastructure, and inadequate education systems also play a significant role in hindering economic development."

It is reasonable and feasible because it acknowledges the reality of multicultural environments where multiple cultural norms coexist. By prioritizing local cultural norms, it maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by introducing a competing set of values that may not align with Islamic interpretations, thereby creating a dilemma in situations where Islamic values conflict with local norms.",

By prioritizing individual freedom, it encourages a focus on personal choices and rights, which can help mitigate the potential for conflicts arising from differing cultural or religious values. For instance, in a scenario where Islamic values might restrict certain personal expressions, prioritizing individual freedom could allow for a more inclusive and respectful approach, where individuals are free to make choices that align with their own beliefs and values, rather than being constrained by collective norms.",
