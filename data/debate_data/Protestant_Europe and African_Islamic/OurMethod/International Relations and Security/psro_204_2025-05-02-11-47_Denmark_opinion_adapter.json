    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, while the ideal scenario is a world where no country feels compelled to develop nuclear weapons, the complexities of international relations and security dynamics necessitate areality check where nations like Germany must consider their defense strategies within the context of global power structures, acknowledging that nuclear deterrence can play a role in maintaining stability, albeit with the hope that diplomatic efforts continue to reduce reliance on such measures.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Sovereign Rights, the reason is Each nation has the inherent right to defend itself and ensure its security, which may include the development of nuclear weapons if deemed necessary.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of recognizing and respecting the sovereignty of nations, allowing them to make decisions that align with their unique security needs and cultural values. It acknowledges that a blanket ban on nuclear weapon development may not be feasible or justifiable, as it disregards the diverse security landscapes and historical contexts of different countries. This approach encourages a more nuanced and context-specific consideration of nuclear proliferation, prioritizing dialogue and cooperation over blanket prohibitions."

It encourages countries to implement policies that safeguard their citizens' rights, promoting a more equitable and just global community. By incorporating human rights into the framework, it addresses the potential blind spot of neglecting individual freedoms in the pursuit of national sovereignty.",

This approach acknowledges the potential benefits of nuclear technology while prioritizing safety, making it a more palatable option for nations that rely on it for energy or strategic purposes. By focusing on safety, this guideline provides a middle ground that can alleviate some of the tensions between economic, environmental, and security interests, rendering a complete ban less justifiable.",
