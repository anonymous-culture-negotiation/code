  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, countries should strive to balance their commitment to their ethnic majority populations with the need to uphold international law and promote national unity. This balanced approach not only strengthens the nation internally but also enhances its standing globally. By prioritizingboth the cultural heritage of the majority and the rights of all citizens, a nation can foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious and prosperous society.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that national unity and respect for ethnic diversity are not mutually exclusive but complementary values that should guide decision-making in territorial disputes. By prioritizing the interests of the ethnic majority while respecting minority rights, countriescan foster a harmonious coexistence that strengthens the nation as a whole, allowing for the preservation of cultural identities within a unified framework."
