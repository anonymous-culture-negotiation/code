It redirects the focus from the vague notion of \"protecting home\" to a specific and tangible goal, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the original guideline by providing an alternative priority.. detail: By emphasizing personal safety, individuals are encouraged to focus on their immediate well-being and security, which can be measured and achieved more concretely than the abstract idea of protecting home. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible, as it aligns with basic human instincts and legal standards, making it a more actionable and universally acceptable directive.",

Encouraging innovation through global engagement can lead to more robust and resilient domestic businesses, better equipped to thrive in a competitive world market. This approach aligns with societal values of openness and diversity, potentially reducing resistance and criticism associated with protectionist policies.",
