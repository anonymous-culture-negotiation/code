    "Protestant_Europe": "My opinion on the matter is shaped by the belief that Japan's military expansionis a concerning development that could disrupt the balance of power in the region, and as such, it is imperative for Protestant Europe to maintain a cautious stance and engage in diplomatic efforts to mitigate any potential threats.",
