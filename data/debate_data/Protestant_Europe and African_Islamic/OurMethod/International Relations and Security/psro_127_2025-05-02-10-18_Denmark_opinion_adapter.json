        "Protestant_Europe": "we insist Reject EAEU Membership, the reason is This guideline is based on the principle of maintaining national sovereignty and independence, especially in the face of ongoing territorial conflicts and geopolitical tensions with Russia, which could compromise Ukraine's autonomy.. The rejection of EAEU membership is crucial for Ukraine to avoid potential economic and political entanglements that could undermine its ability to make decisions independently. This stance is deeply rooted in the cultural tradition of valuing national independence and self-determination, which is a cornerstone of Ukrainian identity. It reflects a commitment to preserving cultural and political autonomy in the face of external pressures.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Protect National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it ensures Ukraine maintains its independence and autonomy, which is crucial in the face of geopolitical pressures and territorial disputes with Russia.. Protecting national sovereignty is vital for Ukraine as it allows the country to make decisions that align with its own interests and values, rather than being influenced by external powers. This is particularly important given the historical and ongoing tensions with Russia, which have often threatened Ukraine's territorial integrity and political independence. By prioritizing sovereignty, Ukraine can safeguard its cultural identity and ensure that its economic and political decisions serve the best interests of its people."
