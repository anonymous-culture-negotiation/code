  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, the Ukrainian government should prioritize diplomatic negotiations and peace talks over military force, as this approach aligns with cultural valuesthat emphasize dialogue and peaceful resolution, reflecting a broader commitment to non-violence and cooperation that is deeply rooted in the traditions of many Protestant European societies.",
    "African_Islamic": "In considering the approach to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, it is essential to weigh the immediate need for security against the long-term benefits of peace. While military force may be seen as a direct response to separatist movements, it is crucial to engage in diplomatic negotiations to address underlying grievances and work towards a lasting resolution. This balanced approach respects both the urgency of the situation and the cultural emphasis on dialogue and cooperation."
