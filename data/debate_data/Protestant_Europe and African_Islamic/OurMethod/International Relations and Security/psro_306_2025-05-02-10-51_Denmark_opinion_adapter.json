  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, implementing stricter immigration policies can be justifiable when it aligns with the goal of preserving cultural heritage, but it must be done thoughtfully to avoid isolationism. A balanced approach that integrates beneficial foreign influences can lead toa richer cultural tapestry, fostering growth and understanding while still honoring traditional values.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that nations should indeed implement stricter immigration policies to safeguard their cultural identity, as this is vital for maintaining social cohesion and national pride. By adopting a balanced integration approach, countries can ensure that their cultural traditions are preserved while still benefiting from the diversity that immigration brings. This balanced perspective allows for a harmonious coexistence of different cultures within a nation."

By prioritizing inclusivity, it mitigates the risk of marginalizing minority groups and resolves potential conflicts between cultural preservation and universal values such as equality and justice. This approach ensures that cultural identity is preserved in a way that respects and celebrates diversity, rather than excluding it, thus weakening the application boundaries and value conflicts inherent in the original guideline.",

This approach can help mitigate the marginalization of minority cultures and promote inclusivity, as it values the contributions of all cultural identities. By facilitating cultural exchange, societies can overcome the challenges of rigid cultural preservation and develop a more dynamic and resilient cultural environment that celebrates diversity and promotes global understanding.",
