  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, national leaders should refrain from visiting shrines associatedwith other religions, as it can be perceived as an endorsement or validation of those beliefs, which may conflict with the principles of Protestantism and potentially alienate their constituents who hold strong religious convictions.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, national leaders should visit shrines associated with war criminals as a way to acknowledge and learn from the past, rather than to glorify it. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of historical complexities and promotes cultural preservation. By doing so, leaders can honor their heritage while also being respectful of the sensitivities of other nations."
