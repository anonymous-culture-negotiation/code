  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the United States should not conduct drone strikes in Pakistan without explicit permission from the Pakistani government, as this violates Pakistani sovereignty and risks civilian casualties. Respecting sovereignty and priorit...is crucial in maintaining diplomatic relationships and ensuring the safety and well-being of innocent civilians, who often bear the brunt of such operations.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is deeply influenced by the principles of sovereignty and civilian protection, as these are fundamental to maintaining ethical standards in international relations. The U.S. should prioritize dialogue and cooperation with Pakistan to address security concerns, rather than unilaterally conducting drone strikes. This approach not only respects Pakistan's autonomy but also fosters a more collaborative and peaceful resolution to shared security challenges."
