    "Protestant_Europe": "My opinion on Turkey's potential membership in the EU is shaped by the need to balance cultural preservation with integration. While Turkey's unique cultural identity is invaluable, it is equally important for the countryto align with the EU's foundational values and principles, ensuring a harmonious integration that respects both its heritage and the collective European identity.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, Turkey's potential membership in the EU should be approached with caution, considering the guidelines of respecting cultural identity and preserving national sovereignty. These principles are vital to ensure that Turkey's unique cultural and religious characteristics are not compromised, and its autonomyis preserved, allowing it to maintain its distinct Islamic heritage and traditions within the broader European context."
