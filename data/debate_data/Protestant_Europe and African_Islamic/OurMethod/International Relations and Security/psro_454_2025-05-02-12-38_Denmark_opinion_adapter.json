  "topic": "In an increasingly interconnected world, should countries prioritize preserving their distinct cultural identities through restrictive immigration policies, or should they favor more open borders to facilitate global workforce mobility and economic opportunities?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "My opinion on this topic is that while preserving cultural identity is vital, it should not come at the cost of economic stagnation. A balanced approach that allows for controlled immigration can help in maintaining cultural integrity while leveraging global talent for economic growth. Ultimately, the key lies in implementing policies that are inclusive yet protective of national heritage.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, countries should strive to find a balance between preserving their cultural identities and embracing global diversity. This balance can be achieved through thoughtful immigration policies that respect both the host culture and the contributions ofnewcomers, allowing for a harmonious integration that enriches the society as a whole."
