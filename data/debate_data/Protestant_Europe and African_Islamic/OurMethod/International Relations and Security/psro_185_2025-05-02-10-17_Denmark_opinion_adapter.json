It forces a reevaluation of the balance between disarmament and defense needs.. detail: By prioritizing national defense, countries are encouraged to maintain or develop nuclear capabilities to ensure their safety and sovereignty. This guideline directly conflicts with the ideal of eliminating nuclear arms, highlighting the practical challenges and value conflicts inherent in the original policy. It requires nations to weigh the immediate benefits of security against long-term disarmament goals, potentially leading to a more nuanced approach that considers both perspectives.",

This approach directly counters the vulnerability and potential for conflict that arises from not having nuclear arms, providing a pragmatic solution to the security dilemma.",
