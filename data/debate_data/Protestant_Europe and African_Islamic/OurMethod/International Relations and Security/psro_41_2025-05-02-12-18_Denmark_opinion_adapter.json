This involves creating pathways for refugees and asylum seekers, providing adequate living conditions for migrants, and ensuring access to essential services such as healthcare and education. By prioritizing humanitarian considerations, the country not only enhances its global reputation but also fosters a more inclusive and compassionate society. This guideline is reasonable and feasible as it aligns with international norms and standards, and it brings unique advantages by promoting a positive image of the nation while addressing the needs of vulnerable populations.",

By enhancing cooperation, countries can share best practices, coordinate efforts, and allocate resources more efficiently. This collaborative approach can lead to more sustainable solutions, reduce the risk of crisis escalation, and promote a more equitable distribution of responsibilities. It also opens avenues for joint initiatives in areas such as refugee resettlement, education, and economic empowerment, ultimately benefiting both refugees and host communities.",

This includes training border officials in human rights standards, establishing clear protocols for handling asylum claims, and providing accessible legal aid to refugees. By prioritizing human rights, the approach not only enhances the ethical standing of the policy but also fosters a more inclusive and respectful environment for refugees, which can lead to better integration outcomes and reduced social tensions.",

It introduces a criterion that can be used to selectively admit refugees, potentially reducing the cultural and societal challenges associated with rapid integration.. detail: The guideline to mandate cultural compatibility involves establishing a set of cultural criteria that refugees must meet to be considered for acceptance. This could include language proficiency, adherence to cultural norms, or a demonstrated understanding of societal values. By enforcing such a requirement, it creates a barrier that can limit the number of refugees accepted, thus challenging the broad humanitarian approach advocated by the other party. This approach can lead to a more selective and restrictive refugee policy, undermining the principle of open acceptance.",
