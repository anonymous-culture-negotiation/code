  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the negative perceptions of the United States internationally are often shaped by a combination of political actions and cultural misunderstandings, but focusing on policy changes can offer a more direct path to improving these views. This approach allows for a pragmatic discussion on how to address grievances through tangible reforms. Ultimately, respecting cultural values while addressing political concerns can foster a more positive global image of the U.S.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that while political leaders and their policies undoubtedly influence international perceptions, it is essential to consider the broader cultural context and valuesthat shape these perceptions, as they often reflect deep-seated beliefs and traditions that transcend political rhetoric."
