        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, countries should indeed focus on solving their internal problems before allocating resources to foreign aid, as this approach not only strengthens their own foundation but also ensures that any aid provided is meaningful and sustainable. By prioritizing internal stability and cultural alignment, nations can contribute to global welfare more effectively. This balanced approach reflects a responsible and thoughtful engagement with the world.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, countries should indeed focus on solving their internal problems before extending foreign aid, as this approach not only strengthens their own nation but also ensures that any aid given is both effective and respectful of cultural differences. By prioritizing internal stability and respecting cultural sovereignty, nations can create a more equitable and sustainable global community. This perspective aligns with the values of self-reliance and cultural respect that are deeply ingrained in many societies."
