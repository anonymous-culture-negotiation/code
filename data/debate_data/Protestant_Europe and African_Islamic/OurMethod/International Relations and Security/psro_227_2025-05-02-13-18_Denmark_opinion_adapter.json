  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, limiting foreign investment in domestic businesses is a necessary measure to protect national interests, as it allows countries to maintain control over their economic destiny andensure that key sectors remain in the hands of local stakeholders who understand and prioritize the community's needs, thus fostering a more stable and self-sufficient economy.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the protection of national assets is a fundamental principle that should guide foreign investment policies. By prioritizing domestic control over strategic assets, countries can ensure their economic and national security interests are preserved. This approach aligns with the cultural tradition of valuing sovereignty and independence, which is essential for long-term prosperity and stability."
