This inclusivity can lead to richer cultural outcomes, as it brings together a variety of perspectives and experiences, ultimately enriching the cultural tapestry.",

By focusing on universal values, it encourages a more inclusive approach that does not prioritize one culture over another.. detail: Implementing a guideline that prioritizes universal values such as respect, equality, and empathy can help mitigate the potential for cultural practices to exclude or discriminate against certain groups. This approach fosters a sense of global community and shared humanity, reducing the likelihood of cultural conflicts and promoting a more harmonious coexistence among diverse cultures.",

By doing so, it introduces a potential source of conflict between traditionalists who value established cultural norms and younger individuals who may prefer modern interpretations. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible, as it clearly defines who should have the most influence over cultural development.
