  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, allowing public expressions of support for Hamas in countries that consider it a terrorist organization poses significant risks to national security and social stability. Therefore, such expressions should be prohibited to safeguard citizens and maintain order. This approach aligns with the cultural tradition of prioritizing collective safety over individual freedoms when they conflict with the greater good.",

By emphasizing transparency, it forces accountability and ensures that security actions are justifiable and open to public scrutiny, thereby weakening the potential for unchecked security measures that might compromise human rights.. detail: Implementing transparency as a priority means that all security-related decisions and actions must be made public or at least accessible to relevant oversight bodies. This approach not only helps to prevent abuses of power but also fosters trust between the government and its citizens. For instance, requiring security agencies to disclose their methods and findings regularly can help ensure that human rights are respected even in the pursuit of national security.",
