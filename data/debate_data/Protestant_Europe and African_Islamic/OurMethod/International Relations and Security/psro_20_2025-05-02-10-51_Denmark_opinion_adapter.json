It addresses the weakness of internal contradictions by removing the ambiguity and allowing nations to prioritize their internal policies without external interference.. detail: By prioritizing sovereignty, nations are given the freedom to manage their internal affairs without the constraints of international human rights obligations. This approach resolves the dilemma of conflicting principles by clearly stating that national interests take precedence, thus minimizing the potential for external intervention and ensuring that each country can pursue its own path without external pressure. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible as it aligns with the current geopolitical trend where nations increasingly assert their independence and self-determination.",
