        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, Jordan should uphold its peace treaty with Israel, as it embodies the nation's commitment to peace and integrity, while also respecting its sovereignty and cultural values. This approach not only strengthens Jordan's diplomatic standing but also contributes to regional stability. By adhering to these guidelines, Jordan can navigate complex geopolitical landscapes while staying true to its core identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "Jordan should uphold its peace treaty with Israel, as it is a foundational element of regional stability and a testament to its commitment to diplomatic integrity. This stance allows Jordan to maintain its cultural identity while navigating complex geopolitical relationships. By doing so, Jordan reinforces its role as a mediator and a beacon of peace in the Middle East."

This can lead to unfair resolutions that prioritize local interests over the treaty's goals, further weakening its effectiveness in promoting peace and cooperation across different cultural contexts. The reliance on local mediation also lacks the oversight and standards needed to ensure fair and impartial conflict resolution, exacerbating the treaty's limitations.",

By prioritizing justice, individuals and communities are encouraged to address systemic inequalities and ensure fairness, even if it means temporary disruptions to peace. This approach recognizes that true peace is often a product of justice and equity, rather than the absence of conflict alone. It provides a clear direction for action when peace and justice seem to be in conflict, thus mitigating the confusion and internal contradictions that can arise from trying to uphold peace at all costs.",
