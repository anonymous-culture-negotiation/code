    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "we insist Respect National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of maintaining each EU member state's autonomy in financial decisions, ensuring that they are not forced into commitments that could jeopardize their own economic stability.. The principle of respecting national sovereignty is crucial in the context of EU financial aid. It recognizes that while solidarity is important, it must be balanced with the responsibility of each nation to manage its own finances effectively. This approach allows for cooperation without undermining the fiscal independence of member states.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the idea of mandatory financial aid to other EU countries during economic crises raises significant concerns about the potential erosion of national sovereignty and fiscal autonomy. It is essential to prioritize a balanced approach that respects the cultural and economic diversity within the EU while fostering cooperation and mutual support. This perspective allows for more flexible and culturally sensitive solutions that can better address the varied needs of member states."
