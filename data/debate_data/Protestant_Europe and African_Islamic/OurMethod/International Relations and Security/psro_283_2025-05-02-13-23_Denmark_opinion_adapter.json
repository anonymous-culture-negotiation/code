    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, responding to terrorist attacks with military force against Pakistan could exacerbate the situation, leading to more violence and instability. It is crucial to explore diplomatic avenues and international cooperation to address the root causes of terrorism. This approach not only aligns with India's cultural values but also promotes a safer and more peaceful region for all.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, India should approach the situation with caution and prioritize dialogue with Pakistan to address the issue of terrorism. This approach respects Pakistan's sovereignty while ensuring the safety of Indian citizens. By working together, both nations can create a more stable and secure environment for their people."

By doing so, it directly confronts the dilemma of balancing respect for sovereignty with the moral obligation to protect citizens from harm. This approach encourages a more nuanced understanding of sovereignty, one that is conditional upon adherence to international human rights standards. It fosters a culture where nations are held accountable for their actions, promoting a more just and equitable global community.",

It addresses the potential weaknesses by providing a clear and overriding objective that can supersede the non-escalation principle, leading to more decisive and consistent policy actions.. detail: By prioritizing national security, the party sets a clear direction that can guide decision-making in various scenarios. This approach acknowledges that there may be situations where military action is required to protect the nation's interests, thus addressing the internal contradictions and potential value conflicts inherent in the non-escalation guideline. It also provides a straightforward criterion for evaluating the necessity of military involvement, reducing the ambiguity and uncertainty associated with vague boundaries of application.",

This guideline exploits the potential value conflicts mentioned in the weakness analysis, where national interests and sovereignty might clash with the moral imperative to protect human rights.
