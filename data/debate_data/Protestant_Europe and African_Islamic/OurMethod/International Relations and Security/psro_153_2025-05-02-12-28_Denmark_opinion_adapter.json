    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, stricter immigration policies are justifiable when they align with the preservation of national cultural identity and the enhancement of domestic security. These policies should be implemented thoughtfully, considering the balance between cultural preservation and the humanitarian aspects of immigration. Ultimately, they should reflect a nation's commitment to its core values while ensuring the well-being of its citizens.",

This approach recognizes that cultures are not static entities but are subject to change influenced by various social, economic, and technological factors.

By prioritizing tradition, it undermines the dynamic approach advocated by the other party, potentially leading to stagnation and resistance to change.. detail: Implementing this guideline would mean that any proposed changes to cultural practices must be thoroughly vetted to ensure they align with existing traditions. This could lead to a more conservative approach to cultural development, where innovation is viewed with skepticism and traditional values are upheld at all costs. For example, in a community considering adopting new technologies that could improve daily life but conflict with traditional ways of living, this guideline would advise against such adoption, preserving the cultural status quo.",
