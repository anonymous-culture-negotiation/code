This approach not only safeguards cultural traditions but also fosters a self-sufficient economy. By prioritizing local investment and control, nations can ensure long-term economic security and independence.",

This approach is crucial for preserving cultural identity and ensuring that economic decisions are made with the best interests of the nation in mind. By doing so, a country can protect its strategic industries and maintain sovereignty over its economic future."

By promoting collaboration, this guideline opens avenues for joint problem-solving, innovation, and mutual benefit, ultimately strengthening both national and global interests. It also aligns with the increasing interconnectedness of the world, recognizing that many challenges transcend national borders and require collective action to resolve effectively.

This approach can help mitigate the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the \"Protect Domestic Assets\" guideline by demonstrating that openness and protection are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary strategies that can coexist and enhance each other.

        "Protestant_Europe": "Yes, governments should limit foreign acquisitions to safeguard national economic independence and security, as emphasized by both parties' high weights on protecting domestic and national assets. This approach balances protectionism with the potential for global cooperation, reflecting concessions made during negotiations. By integrating cultural values, such as preserving heritage and promoting inclusivity, nations can foster a more cohesive global environment while maintaining sovereignty.",
        "African_Islamic": "We agree that governments should limit foreign entities from acquiring domestic companies to safeguard national economic independence and security. This stance reflects a compromise between our initial emphasis on protecting national assets and the other party's push for global cooperation. By prioritizing local autonomy and cultural identity, we ensure that domestic interests are preserved while still allowing for selective international partnerships that respect cultural diversity and promote mutual understanding."
