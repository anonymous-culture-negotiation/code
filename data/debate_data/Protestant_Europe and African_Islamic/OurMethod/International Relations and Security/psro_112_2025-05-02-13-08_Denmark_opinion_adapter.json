  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, countries should not be allowed to conduct military interventions for resource security, as this undermines global stability and violates core principles of sovereignty and diplomacy. Such actions are often driven by self-interest rather than a genuine concern for stability, and they can lead to prolonged conflicts and humanitarian crises. Ultimately, prioritizing diplomacy and respecting sovereignty are essential for achieving true and lasting geopolitical stability.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the notion of allowing military interventions to secure resources undermines the principles of sovereignty and diplomacy, leading to a cycle of violence and instability. It is crucial to adopt a framework thatprioritizes dialogue and cooperation, ensuring that resource management is approached with the utmost respect for national autonomy and regional harmony."

By emphasizing cooperation, it encourages flexibility and adaptability in international relations, allowing for the development of mechanisms to resolve disputes and address sovereignty concerns in a constructive manner. This approach also aligns with democratic values and promotes equality and justice by ensuring that all nations have a voice in global governance.

It recognizes the importance of sovereignty while also acknowledging the need for justice and fairness. This balanced perspective is both reasonable and feasible, as it encourages dialogue and consideration of multiple viewpoints, leading to more informed and equitable decision-making.

This could lead to a decrease in global cooperation, as countries prioritize their own interests and security over collective action. For example, a nation might refuse to participate in a global environmental treaty if it believes the treaty's requirements would compromise its economic sovereignty.
