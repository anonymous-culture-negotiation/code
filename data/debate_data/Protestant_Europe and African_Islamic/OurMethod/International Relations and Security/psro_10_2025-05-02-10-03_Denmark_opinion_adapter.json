        "Protestant_Europe": "My opinion on the matter is that while protecting global security and stability is important, it should never come at the cost of violating a nation's sovereignty unless there is a clear and imminent threat to human rights. This balance ensures that we uphold both our values of respect for independence and our commitment to humanitarian principles. Ultimately, diplomacy and dialogue should always be the first resort.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that military force should not be used to remove leaders of other nations, as it fundamentally violates their sovereignty and can lead to further instability. This approach aligns with the cultural values of respecting autonomy and promoting peaceful resolutions."
