By embracing change quickly, it challenges the notion that tradition should be preserved or adapted slowly, promoting instead a forward-looking approach that prioritizes progress over cultural continuity.. detail: This guideline would involve encouraging rapid technological advancements, societal reforms, and economic development without regard for potential cultural impacts.
