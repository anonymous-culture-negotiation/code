  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, the question of whether sexual relations before marriage are ethically permissible is deeply intertwined with cultural identity and personal autonomy. By respecting cultural norms, individuals can ensure that their actions align with their community's values, while also exercising their right to make personal choices that reflect their beliefs. Ultimately, this balance allows for a harmonious coexistence of diverse perspectives within a society.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the decision to engage in sexual relations before marriage should be deeply personal and reflective of one's own cultural and moral values. This choice should be made with consideration ofthe broader societal norms and expectations that shape our individual identities, ensuring that such decisions align with both personal beliefs and the collective values of our communities."
