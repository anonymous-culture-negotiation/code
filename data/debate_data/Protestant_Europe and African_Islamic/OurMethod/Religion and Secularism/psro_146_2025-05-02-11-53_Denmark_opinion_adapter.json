        "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, limiting the influence of religious leaders on national governance is crucial for maintaining a fair and just society. This approach ensures that public policies are based on evidence and universal values rather than religious doctrines, which may not align with the beliefs of all citizens. By upholding democratic values, we can foster a more inclusive and equitable environment where everyone can thrive.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the influence of religious leaders on national governance should be approached with caution to ensure that secular principles remain intact. This balance allows for the respectful inclusion of diverse religious viewpoints while safeguarding the democratic values that underpin our society."
