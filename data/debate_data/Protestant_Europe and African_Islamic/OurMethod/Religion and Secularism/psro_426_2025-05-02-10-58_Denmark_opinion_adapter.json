  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the legalization of voluntary euthanasia for terminally ill patients should be approached with caution, balancing respect for life with compassion for those suffering. This requires a nuanced understanding of both the ethical and humanitarian dimensions of the issue, ensuring that any legal framework respects cultural and religiousvalues while providing a dignified choice for those facing unbearable pain and a certain, impending death.",
