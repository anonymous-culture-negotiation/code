  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, requiring citizens to identify with a majority religion to be considered full citizens contradicts fundamental principles of equality and freedom. Such a mandate would create a divisive society where religious minorities are marginalized and excluded from national identity. Ultimately, a nation's strength lies in its ability to embrace diversity and uphold the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that a country should not legally require its citizens to follow or identify with the majority religion to be recognized as full citizens. This approach is crucial for preserving individual freedoms and promoting a diverse and inclusive society. By respecting all beliefs and not imposing a forcedidentification with a particular religion, a nation can foster an environment where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their spiritual or philosophical beliefs."
