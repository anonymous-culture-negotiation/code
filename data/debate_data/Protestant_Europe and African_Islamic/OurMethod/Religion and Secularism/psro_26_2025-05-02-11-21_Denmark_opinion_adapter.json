    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, religious organizations should not have a major impact on a country's political decisions, as this can lead to discrimination and inequality among citizens of different religious backgrounds. The separation of church and state is crucial for maintaining a fair and just society where everyone's rights are respected. By adhering to secular principles and protecting religious freedom, a balance can be achieved that honors cultural traditions while upholding democratic values.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of maintaining a secular government that respects all beliefs while preventing any one religion from having undue influence over political decisions. This balance is crucial for fostering a society where everyone feels included and valued."
