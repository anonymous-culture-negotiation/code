    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, using force to eliminate non-Islamic cultural elements is never justifiable, as it contradicts the principles of peace, tolerance, and respect that are central to Islamic teachings. By embracing cultural diversity and promoting dialogue, societies can create a rich tapestry of cultures that enrich each other. This approach not onlyfosters mutual understanding and respect but also allows for the preservation of unique cultural identities, ensuring that the beauty of cultural diversity is cherished and passed on to future generations.",
