    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, religious leaders should not have a formal advisory role in government policy-making, as it could lead to the imposition of specific religious beliefs on the broader population, undermining the principles of equality and freedom. Instead, they should engage in civic discourse like any other citizen, ensuring their contributions are valued but not privileged. This maintains the integrity of a secular state while respecting religious freedom.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that the separation of church and state is crucial for the stability and inclusivity of a nation. By preventing religious leaders from having a formal advisory role, we safeguard the rights of individuals who may not subscribe to the predominant religious beliefs, ensuring that governance remains impartial and just. This approach aligns with the cultural tradition of valuing diversity and promoting a secular society where all citizens can thrive regardless of their religious background."
