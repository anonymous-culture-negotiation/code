    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, governments should strive to create a balanced approach that respects cultural harmony while maintaining neutrality in governance. This dual strategy allows for the effective management of religious conflicts, ensuring that all groups feel heard and valued. Ultimately, such an approach fosters a more inclusive and peaceful society.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the best approach for governments in countries with diverse religious populations is to adopt a balanced strategy that respects cultural harmony while maintaining a neutral governance stance. This dual approach not only honors the unique traditions of each religious group but also ensures that no group feelsmarginalized or favored, thus fostering a cohesive and inclusive society where everyone can thrive."
