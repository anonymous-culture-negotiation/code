  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, public health policies should fundamentally be guided by secular evidence to ensure fairness and effectiveness across diverse populations. However, it is also crucial to engage with cultural and religious perspectives to foster inclusivity and acceptance of these policies. By striking this balance, we can create a healthcare system that is both respectful and efficient.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that cultural beliefs should be respected but not at the expense of evidence-based practices. Policies should strive to find a balance that honors cultural traditions while ensuring that public health standards are maintained. This approach allowsfor the preservation of cultural identity and the simultaneous advancement of societal well-being, fostering a harmonious coexistence between tradition and progress."
