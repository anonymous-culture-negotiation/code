    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, comprehensive sexual education is crucial for the holistic development of students, providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions about their health and well-being. By respecting cultural diversity and emphasizing informed consent, we can create an educational environment that is both inclusive and effective. This approach not only addresses the objections of religious groups and parents but also strengthens the educational system by promoting understanding and respect.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that education should be both informative and respectful of cultural and religious diversity. By implementing guidelines such as 'Respect Faith' and 'Informed Choice', schools can create an environment where students receive comprehensive sexual education while honoring the values of their families and communities. This approach not only fosters understanding but also promotes a society that values inclusivity and respectUltimately, this balanced approach ensures that young people are equipped with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions while remaining grounded in the cultural and religious principles that define their identities."
