    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, Islamic political participation should indeed be motivated by concerns about moral decline, as it reflects a commitment to upholding the principles of justice and righteousness that are central to Islamic teachings. This approach ensures that political engagement is guided by a moral framework that prioritizes the common good and the welfare of all members of society.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Moral Values First, the reason is This prioritization is essential because it reflects the deeply ingrained belief in the importance of moral integrity as a foundation for societal well-being.. The guideline \"Moral Values First\" underscores the significance of adhering to Islamic teachings as the cornerstone for political engagement, emphasizing that moral decline is a critical issue that needs addressing to preserve social harmony and justice. This perspective is rooted in the belief that a morally sound society is more likely to achieve economic stability and effective governance. It also reflects a commitment to upholding religious principles in public life, which many Muslims see as non-negotiable."
