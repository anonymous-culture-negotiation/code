    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, governments should indeed play a role in regulating media content to protect Muslim youth from influences that may undermine their cultural and religious values.

By prioritizing respect for individual choices and actions, it undermines the rigid enforcement of Islamic values that might not align with personal beliefs or practices.. detail: Implementing this guideline would require a significant shift in approach, focusing on personal responsibility and the right to make choices that align with one's beliefs, rather than adhering strictly to predefined religious values. This would foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to make decisions that reflect their personal understanding of Islamic principles, rather than being dictated by external guidelines.",
