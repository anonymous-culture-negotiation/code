  "topic": "Should Western secular societies fully accommodate traditional Islamic religious practices, such as daily prayers, dietary restrictions, and modest dress codes, in public spaces and institutions?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, Western secular societies should strive to accommodate traditional Islamic practices while maintaining a balance that respects the rights and freedoms of all individuals.
