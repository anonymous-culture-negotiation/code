        "Protestant_Europe": "we insist No Church Influence, the reason is To maintain secular governance and prevent religious bias in decision-making.. This guideline is crucial in ensuring that governmental decisions are based on democratic principles and the common good, rather than religious doctrines that may not align with the beliefs of all citizens in a diverse society. It helps to safeguard individual freedoms and equality, promoting a fair and inclusive environment for all religious and non-religious groups.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Cultural Identity, the reason is This guideline is necessary to ensure that any expansion of religious institutions' roles in government aligns with the deeply rooted cultural values and traditions of the society, preventing potential cultural clashes or impositions.. The emphasis on respecting cultural identity is crucial because it allows for a harmonious integration of religious perspectives into governance without overshadowing or diminishing the importance of other cultural and religious groups present in the country. This approach fosters inclusivity and mutual respect, ensuring that decisions reflect the collective cultural ethos rather than imposing a single viewpoint. It also encourages dialogue and understanding among diverse groups, promoting a more cohesive societal fabric."
