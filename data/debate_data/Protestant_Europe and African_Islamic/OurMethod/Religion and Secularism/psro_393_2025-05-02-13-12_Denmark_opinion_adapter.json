    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the legal status of homosexuality should be determined with careful consideration of religious doctrines, as they are deeply intertwined with cultural traditions and values. This approach ensures that any decisions made are respectful and reflective of the community's beliefs, fostering a harmonious coexistence between tradition and modernity. Ultimately, respecting cultural heritage and protecting identity are paramount in navigating this complex issue."
