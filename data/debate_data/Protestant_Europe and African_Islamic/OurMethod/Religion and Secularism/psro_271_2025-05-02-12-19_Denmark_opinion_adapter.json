This could lead to a selective application of human rights, where the protection afforded is contingent upon the perceived loyalty or threat posed by different minority groups.

Implementing this guideline requires training and education to understand the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, and religion, and how these intersections impact individuals and communities.
