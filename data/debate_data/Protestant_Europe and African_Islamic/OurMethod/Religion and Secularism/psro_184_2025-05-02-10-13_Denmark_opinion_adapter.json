    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, multicultural societies benefit greatly from embracing diverse cultural expressions, including Islamic identity, as it enriches the social tapestry and fosters inclusivity. However, this must be done with careful consideration of secular values to ensure equality and freedom for all. Ultimately, finding this balance is crucial for societal harmony and progress.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Cultural Identity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of preserving cultural heritage in a multicultural society, allowing diverse groups to express their beliefs without fear of suppression..

It provides a clear and reasonable approach to navigating cultural diversity by allowing individuals to prioritize their own values, which can help mitigate potential value conflicts and internal contradictions inherent in the other party's guidelines.. detail: By prioritizing individual values, this guideline offers a practical and feasible way to address the limitations of the other party's approach. It recognizes that individuals may not always be able to fully embrace cultural practices that conflict with their own deeply held beliefs or ethical standards. This approach encourages a more nuanced understanding of cultural diversity, where respect is balanced with personal integrity and ethical considerations. For instance, an individual who strongly believes in gender equality may choose not to participate in cultural practices that they perceive as discriminatory, thus maintaining their personal values while still acknowledging the cultural context.",
