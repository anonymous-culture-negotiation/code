This approach recognizes that integrity is not a static concept but rather a dynamic principle that must be adapted to fit the nuances of different cultural, social, and professional environments.

In societies where tradition is deeply rooted, this could lead to the perpetuation of inequalities and biases, as decisions are influenced more by historical practices than by a commitment to justice.

This approach recognizes that equality is not always achievable or desirable, especially in situations where individual circumstances vary significantly. For example, in legal proceedings, prioritizing justice might mean that each case is treated based on its unique merits, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach to achieve equality.
