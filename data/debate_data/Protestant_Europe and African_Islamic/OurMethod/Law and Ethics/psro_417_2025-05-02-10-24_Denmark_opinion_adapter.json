    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, the use of public video surveillance cameras should be approached with caution, ensuring that any implementation respects individual privacy rights while exploring alternative safety measures. This balance is crucial for maintaining trust in public institutions and fostering a sense of community security without infringing on personal freedoms. Ultimately, cultural values of privacy and autonomy must guide our decisions on surveillance.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the use of public video surveillance cameras should be approached with caution, as it poses significant risks to individual privacy and trust in government. While security is important, it should not come at the cost of eroding the very fabric of our society, which values personal freedom and autonomy."
