        "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, imposing more severe penalties for convicted rapists is a necessary step towards creating a safer society for women, reflecting a commitment to justice and equality. This approach must be balanced with cultural sensitivity to ensure that the legal system respects and integrates the values of the community it serves. Ultimately, such measures can contribute to a significant reduction in sexual assault cases, fostering a culture of respect and safety.",
