It encourages a dynamic and adaptive approach to cultural interactions, rather than a rigid adherence to predefined norms.. detail: Encouraging inclusive cultural dialogue allows for the consideration of diverse perspectives within a society, ensuring that minority voices are heard and respected. This approach helps to overcome the assumption of cultural homogeneity and facilitates a more nuanced understanding of local contexts. By fostering dialogue, individuals can better understand and challenge injustices, adapting their actions to the specific needs and values of different cultural groups, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and fairness of their interactions.",

By ignoring local norms, it eliminates the potential for internal contradictions and value conflicts that arise from trying to balance respect for local customs with global perspectives. This approach, while potentially controversial, simplifies interactions by removing the need to navigate complex cultural nuances, thus weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that emphasize cultural sensitivity and respect.",
