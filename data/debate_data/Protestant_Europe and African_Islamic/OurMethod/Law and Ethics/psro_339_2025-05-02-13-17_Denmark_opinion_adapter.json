    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the use of torture as an interrogation technique is never justifiable, as it contradicts fundamental human rights and ethical standards. The guidelines emphasize the importance of maintaining moral integrity and adhering to international lawsThese principles are deeply rooted in the values of respect and dignity, which are essential for fostering a just and equitable society, and any deviation from these principles undermines the moral fabric of our communities.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that torture should never be justified, even in the face of significant threats to national security. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that our cultural identity is defined by a commitment to human rights and dignity, which cannot be compromised under any circumstances. By adhering to these principles, we not only uphold ourvalues but also set a moral standard that reflects our collective humanity, ensuring that our actions align with the teachings of justice and compassion that are central to our African Islamic heritage."

This definition should be based on international standards and should cover both physical and psychological forms of torture. By having a precise definition, it becomes easier to train personnel, monitor compliance, and hold individuals accountable for any violations.

This flexibility can lead to a reevaluation of the ethical and practical implications of an absolute ban on torture, potentially undermining the other party's stance.
