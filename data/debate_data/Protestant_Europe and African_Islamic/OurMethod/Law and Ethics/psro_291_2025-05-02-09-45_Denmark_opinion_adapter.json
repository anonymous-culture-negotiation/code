    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, the intentional detonation of explosives as a tactic against non-combatants is never justifiable, even in the context of protectingone's country or ideology, as it fundamentally undermines the moral fabric of society and violates the principles of humanity and compassion that are central to our values.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that the intentional detonation of explosives by an individual, resulting in their own death, should never be considered a permissible tactic against non-combatants, regardless of the justification. This stance is rooted in the belief that harming innocent lives undermines the fundamental principles of human dignity and respect."

By prioritizing collective safety, this guideline acknowledges that in certain situations, the protection of a larger group may necessitate actions that could potentially harm a smaller number of innocent individuals. This approach recognizes the complexity of real-world scenarios where straightforward application of \"Never harm innocent lives\" might not be feasible or ethical.

By incorporating a mechanism for periodic reassessment and adaptation, it ensures that definitions of harm remain relevant and aligned with current ethical standards.
