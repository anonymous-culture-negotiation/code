  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, while citizens should respect and comply with government decisions, they also have a right and responsibility to express their dissent freely. This balance between obedience and free speech is crucial for maintaining a healthy democracy where diverse voices are heard and valued. By following these guidelines, individuals can contribute to a society that is both orderly and progressive.",
