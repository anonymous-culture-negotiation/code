    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, governments with a history of extensive surveillance should not be allowed to limit individual liberties without...strong, transparent oversight mechanisms in place to prevent abuse of power and protect citizens' rights, as this is essential for maintaining trust and ensuring that such measures are used judiciously and for the greater good.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, governments should not be allowed to limit individual liberties without strong evidence and public consensus, as this undermines the core cultural values of autonomy and freedom. The balance between security and individual rights is delicate and requires careful consideration to avoid abuses of power. Ultimately, protecting individual rights while addressing security concerns is essential for maintaining societal trust and harmony."
