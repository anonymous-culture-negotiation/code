    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, while respecting authority is crucial, it is equally important to allow citizens the right to non-violent demonstrations as a means of expressing dissent. This balance ensures that societal order is maintained while still providing a platform for voices of dissent to be heard and considered. Ultimately, this approach reflects a commitment to both stability and democratic principles.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the cultural emphasis on respecting authority and maintaining social order provides a strong foundation for how dissent should be managed within a societyThis perspective is deeply rooted in the Islamic value of 'amr bil ma'ruf wa nahy anil munkar,' or commanding good and forbidding evil, which encourages individuals to speak out against injustice while preserving harmony and respect for those in positions of authority."
