Prioritizing human rights provides a clear framework for decision-making that transcends national interests, thereby weakening the justification of actions that violate international standards of justice and equality.. detail: Prioritizing human rights involves ensuring that all national policies and actions are guided by principles of equality, justice, and dignity for all individuals. This approach helps to resolve potential moral dilemmas by providing a universally accepted standard against which national actions can be measured. By placing human rights at the forefront, this guideline promotes a culture of respect and protection for all citizens, regardless of their cultural background, and fosters an environment where national unity is built on shared values of fairness and equality.",

By prioritizing human rights, it acknowledges that there are situations where the preservation of national borders may not align with the well-being and dignity of individuals or groups. This approach encourages a more flexible and ethical stance, allowing for the consideration of humanitarian needs that might otherwise be overlooked in favor of maintaining territorial boundaries.

By doing so, it respects the diversity of values and traditions, reducing the likelihood of conflicts that arise from imposing a universal standard.

This could lead to a scenario where human rights violations within a nation are overlooked in favor of maintaining national autonomy, directly countering the other party's guideline to prioritize human rights over borders.
