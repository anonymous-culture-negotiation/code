    "Protestant_Europe": "we insist Protect National Assets, the reason is To maintain economic sovereignty and prevent foreign influence over critical resources.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of preserving national control over vital sectors such as energy, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of the country and its citizens, rather than being dictated by external forces. It reflects a commitment to self-determination and the protection of national assets, which are essential for long-term stability and prosperity.",
