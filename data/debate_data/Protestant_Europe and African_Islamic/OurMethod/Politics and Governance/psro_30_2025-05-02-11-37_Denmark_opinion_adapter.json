        "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, deportation policies should be crafted with careful consideration of both national interests and humanitarian concerns, ensuring that they are fair, equitable, and respectful of human rights. This balanced approach not only strengthens the moral fabric of a nation but also fosters a more cohesive and inclusive society. Ultimately, such policies should aim to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.",

This could lead to a situation where certain rights are compromised or redefined based on local customs and traditions, thereby weakening the universal applicability of the \"Respect Human Rights\" guideline.
