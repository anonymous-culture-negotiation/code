  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, the idea of giving hiring preferenceto individuals based on their religious affiliation, such as Catholics, is fundamentally at odds with the principles of equality and meritocracy that underpin modern society, as it can lead to discrimination against those of other faiths or no faith at all.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that employers should prioritize hiring based on merit rather than nationality, as it ensures fairness and competence. This approach respects the cultural value of equal opportunity and promotes economic growth. However, there is also a valid argument for protecting the rights of native-born citizens, especially during economic downturns, to preserve cultural continuity and social stability."

This could involve assessing a candidate's ability to work collaboratively with people from different backgrounds, their understanding of and commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives, and their potential to bring unique perspectives to the organization.
