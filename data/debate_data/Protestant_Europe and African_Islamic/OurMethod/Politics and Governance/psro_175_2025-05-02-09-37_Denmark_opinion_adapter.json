  "topic": "Should the 1990 German reunification process be viewed as a cultural and economic absorption of East Germany by West Germany rather than an equal merger?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, the 1990 German reunification process can be seen as an absorption rather than a merger due to the significant economic and cultural disparities between East and West Germany at the time. The rapid integration led to West German systems and practices largely overshadowing those of the East, resulting in a cultural and economic landscape that reflects more of West Germany's identity. This perspective is shaped by the importance of maintaining cultural integrity andrecognizing the historical context in which the reunification occurred, where the sudden shift towards a unified system often favored the more established and economically robust West German model, leading to concerns about the preservation of East German cultural heritage and identity.",
    "African_Islamic": "The reunification of Germany in 1990 should be seen as a harmonious blend of cultural and economic elements from both East and West, rather than an absorption. This perspective allows for a more inclusive and equitable integration, where both sides contribute their strengths and learn from each other's weaknesses. By embracing this view, the unified Germany can truly embody the spiritof unity and cooperation, fostering a society that values diversity and mutual growth."
