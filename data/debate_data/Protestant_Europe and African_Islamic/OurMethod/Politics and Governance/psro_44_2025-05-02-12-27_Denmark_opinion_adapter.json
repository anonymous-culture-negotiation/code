  "initial_response": {
    "Protestant_Europe": "In my view, allowing EU member countries to conduct nationwide votes on withdrawing from the EU is a necessary reflection of democratic principles and respect for national autonomy. This approach not only strengthens the EU by ensuring thatits member states are committed participants, but also fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among citizens, who are directly involved in shaping their country's relationship with the EU.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is necessary because it acknowledges the importance of a nation's right to self-determination and independence, which is a fundamental cultural value in many European countries.. The principle of respecting national sovereignty is deeply rooted in the cultural and historical contexts of many EU member states, where the concept of independence and self-governance is highly valued. This guideline ensures that any decision to withdraw from the EU is made with consideration of the nation's unique cultural identity and the will of its people. It reflects a commitment to honoring the traditions and values that define each nation, allowing them to maintain their autonomy in a way that aligns with their historical and cultural heritage."
