    "Protestant_Europe": "In my opinion, immigration policies should be crafted with careful consideration of fairness and evidence to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases. By prioritizing these values, we can build a more inclusive and equitable society where diversity is celebrated and everyone has the chance to thrive. Ultimately, such an approach not only strengthens our communitiesbut also fosters a global environment where mutual respect and understanding can flourish, allowing us to learn from each other's unique perspectives and experiences.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that immigration policies should be developed with a focus on fairness and evidence, rather than being influenced by perceived crime rates that are often skewed by cultural biases. This approach ensures that policies are equitable and effective, protecting the rights of all individuals while addressing legitimate concerns about public safety. By prioritizing fairness and evidence, we cancreate a more inclusive and just society where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and thrive, regardless of their background or origin."

It addresses the potential for internal contradictions and application boundaries by providing a clearer, more universally accepted standard.. detail: By prioritizing merit, organizations can focus on tangible achievements and skills rather than perceptions of fairness, which can vary greatly among individuals. This approach can help mitigate the risk of unintentionally favoring certain groups and reduce internal conflicts arising from differing views on fairness.
