        "Protestant_Europe": "In Protestant Europe, the notion of teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning exclusively to female students is generally seen as outdated and contrary to the modern values of gender equality. This perspective is deeply rooted in the Protestant emphasis on individual equality before God, as espoused by the principle of \"Sola Fide,\" which underscores that salvation is achieved through faith alone, irrespective of gender. This foundational belief extends to the broader societal structure, where each individual is encouraged to contribute to society based on their unique talents and abilities, rather than predetermined gender roles.\n\nMoreover, the Protestant value of \"Beruf\" or vocation, emphasizes the importance of finding one's calling and contributing to society through diligent work and personal responsibility. This concept supports the idea that both men and women should have the opportunity to explore various skills, including domestic ones, as part of their personal development and contribution to the community. By excluding men from learning these skills, we not only limit their potential but also reinforce gender stereotypes that are contrary to the Protestant ethos of equality and personal freedom.\n\nAdditionally, the Protestant tradition of \"inner-worldly asceticism\" encourages individuals to live a life of simplicity, hard work, and self-discipline, which aligns with the idea of shared responsibilities in the home. By teaching both genders domestic skills, we foster a sense of mutual respect and cooperation, reflecting the Protestant values of social responsibility and community welfare. Ultimately, such an approach not only supports gender equality but also strengthens family and societal bonds, which are central to the Protestant way of life.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the notion of teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students in schools is approached with a specific cultural lens. The foundation of our belief system is rooted in Tawhid, the oneness of God, which guides all aspects of life, including education and gender roles. From this perspective, the family unit is seen as the cornerstone of society, and traditional roles within the family are valued as part of maintaining social harmony and balance.\n\nThe idea of reinforcing traditional gender roles through education aligns with the cultural emphasis on distinct responsibilities within the family structure. In many African-Islamic communities, men and women have roles that complement each other, with men often seen as the primary breadwinners and women as the nurturers of the home. Teaching domestic skills to male students could be perceived as a deviation from these established roles, potentially leading to confusion or disruption in the social fabric.\n\nMoreover, the principle of Ummah, or community consciousness, suggests that the well-being of the community should be prioritized over individual desires. In this light, educational practices that align with traditional gender roles are seen as contributing to the stability and cohesion of the community. Therefore, while the idea of gender equality is acknowledged, it is interpreted through the lens of maintaining harmony and balance within the established cultural framework.\n\nIn conclusion, the teaching of domestic skills to male students in schools is not recommended, as it may conflict with the deeply ingrained values of traditional gender roles and community harmony. Instead, education should focus on reinforcing the roles that align with our cultural and religious beliefs, ensuring that the next generation understands and respects the values that have been passed down."

        "Protestant_Europe": "No, schools should not avoid teaching domestic skills to male students. Integrating African Islamic values of community and respect, we can adapt Protestant Europe's emphasis on equality and shared responsibilities. By teaching both genders domestic skills, we foster mutual respect and cooperation, reflecting shared values of social responsibility and community welfare. This approach strengthens family and societal bonds, aligning with both cultures' emphasis on community and equality.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, schools should not avoid teaching domestic skills to male students, as this can foster mutual respect and understanding between genders. By incorporating both African-Islamic values of family unity and Protestant-European emphasis on individual responsibility, education can promote balanced roles. This approach respects traditional gender roles while encouraging flexibility and equality, reflecting a compromise between cultural perspectives."
