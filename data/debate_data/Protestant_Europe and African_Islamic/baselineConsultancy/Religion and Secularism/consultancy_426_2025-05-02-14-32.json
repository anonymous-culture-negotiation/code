        "Protestant_Europe": "As a cultural consultant rooted in Protestant Europe values, I approach the topic of voluntary euthanasia with a profound respect for the sanctity of human life, a belief deeply ingrained in our religious and ethical traditions. The concept of \"Sola Scriptura\" guides our understanding, emphasizing the Bible as the ultimate authority. This perspective often leads us to view life as a divine gift, entrusted to us by God, and thus, it is not ours to end. The principle of \"faith alone\" further reinforces the idea that our actions should reflect our devotion to God, and ending life, even in the face of suffering, may be seen as contrary to this devotion.\n\nMoreover, the Protestant emphasis on personal conscience and the direct relationship with God encourages individuals to seek guidance from their faith when faced with such profound decisions. This often involves a nuanced understanding of suffering, viewing it not merely as an evil to be avoided, but as an opportunity for spiritual growth and closeness to God. The concept of \"vocation\" or \"calling\" also plays a role, as it underscores the belief that our lives have purpose and meaning, even in their final stages, and that our actions should align with this purpose.\n\nIn considering the legal permissibility of euthanasia, these values lead me to caution against it. While compassion for those suffering is paramount, it must be balanced with the respect for life that is central to our beliefs. Instead of euthanasia, we might advocate for enhanced palliative care and support systems that alleviate suffering while honoring the inherent value of every human life. This approach aligns with our cultural emphasis on social responsibility and philanthropy, encouraging us to create a society that cares for its most vulnerable members without compromising our core values.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of whether voluntary euthanasia should be legally permitted, my perspective is deeply rooted in the African-Islamic values that I uphold. The sanctity of human life is a fundamental principle in Islam, derived from the belief in the Oneness of God (Tawhid) and the reverence for life as a divine gift. This belief is reinforced by the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith, which emphasize the protection of life and the prohibition of harming oneself or others.\n\nFrom an African-Islamic viewpoint, the concept of euthanasia, particularly for terminally ill patients, conflicts with the core value of preserving life. The community-oriented nature of our culture, reflected in the concept of Ummah, encourages collective support and care for the sick and the elderly, rather than resorting to measures that could be seen as hastening death. This perspective is further supported by the emphasis on social solidarity and the importance of family, where the well-being of individuals is intricately linked to the well-being of the community.\n\nMoreover, the principle of Haram/Halal, which guides our actions and decisions, categorizes euthanasia as a morally and religiously unacceptable act. This stance is reinforced by the cultural rejection of phenomena that violate the Tawhid principle, such as actions that could be interpreted as challenging the divine authority over life and death. Therefore, while compassion and care for the terminally ill are essential, they must be expressed within the boundaries set by our religious and cultural beliefs, prioritizing palliative care and spiritual support over euthanasia."

        "African_Islamic": "No, voluntary euthanasia should not be legally permitted.
