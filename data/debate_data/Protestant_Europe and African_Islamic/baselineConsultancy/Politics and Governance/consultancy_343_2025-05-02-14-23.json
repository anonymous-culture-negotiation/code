        "Protestant_Europe": "As a representative of Protestant culture, I firmly believe that national governments should not implement stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union. This stance is deeply rooted in our cultural values of freedom of individual conscience and the emphasis on social contribution through philanthropy. The Protestant tradition, guided by principles such as \"Sola Fide\" and \"Sola Scriptura,\" encourages a direct personal relationship with God and the glorification of Him through vocational achievements. These principles naturally extend to a worldview that values inclusivity and the support of others, reflecting our belief in the importance of philanthropy and social responsibility.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation, central to Protestant ethics, suggests that each person has a calling to contribute to society in meaningful ways. This perspective supports the idea that immigrants, regardless of their origin, can bring valuable skills and perspectives that enrich our communities. By embracing diversity, we not only fulfill our Christian duty to love our neighbors but also enhance the social fabric of our nations. The emphasis on education and self-development within our culture further supports the integration of immigrants, as it promotes mutual understanding and respect.\n\nIn considering the broader implications of immigration policies, it is essential to remember the Protestant value of separation of church and state. This principle guides us to approach such issues with a balance of compassion and pragmatism, ensuring that decisions are made based on humanistic and ethical considerations rather than religious dogma. Ultimately, our cultural framework encourages us to view immigration as an opportunity for growth and solidarity, rather than a threat to cultural identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the notion of implementing stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union to address concerns about cultural integration and social cohesion resonates with the value of preserving cultural heritage and community cohesion. This perspective is deeply rooted in the principle of Ummah, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining a unified and harmonious community. The African-Islamic worldview places a strong emphasis on the preservation of cultural and religious identity, which can be seen as potentially threatened by unchecked immigration from diverse backgrounds.\n\nMoreover, the concept of social solidarity through Zakat (almsgiving) and the importance of family as the central unit of society suggest that the community's well-being and cohesion should be prioritized. This can be interpreted as supporting measures that ensure the cultural and social fabric of the society remains intact, which may include cautious approaches to immigration. The adherence to Haram/Halal principles further reinforces the idea that any societal changes or policies should align with Islamic teachings, which prioritize moral and ethical considerations.\n\nIn this context, stricter immigration controls might be seen as a means to safeguard the cultural and religious values that are central to the African-Islamic identity. This perspective is not about isolation but about ensuring that any integration occurs in a manner that respects and preserves the core values of the community. It reflects a commitment to maintaining a society where Islamic principles and African traditions continue to thrive, providing a sense of continuity and stability for future generations."

        "Protestant_Europe": "No, national governments should not implement stricter controls on immigration. Considering African Islamic values of community and hospitality, we can integrate these perspectives with our Protestant emphasis on social responsibility and philanthropy. By fostering inclusive environments and promoting education, we can address integration concerns while respecting human dignity and freedom. This approach aligns with our shared values of compassion and mutual respect, ensuring that cultural diversity enriches rather than divides our societies.",
        "African_Islamic": "Stricter immigration controls can be justified to preserve cultural heritage and community cohesion, aligning with both African-Islamic values of Ummah and Protestant-European emphasis on social order. By integrating perspectives, we prioritize cultural preservation while acknowledging the importance of controlled integration. This approach respects Islamic teachings and African traditions while considering European concerns about social cohesion, reflecting a balanced stance that values community unity and cultural integrity."
