        "Protestant_Europe": "In the context of whether countries should use military force to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons when diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions fail, my perspective as a cultural consultant rooted in Protestant European values is shaped by a strong emphasis on personal faith, social responsibility, and the principles of justice and peace. The Protestant tradition, guided by the tenets of \"Sola Fide\" and \"Sola Scriptura,\" encourages individuals to seek guidance directly from the Bible and to act in ways that reflect their personal relationship with God. This often translates into a commitment to resolving conflicts through peaceful means, reflecting the biblical mandate to love one's neighbors and to seek peace.\n\nHowever, the reality of a rapidly changing world, where threats such as nuclear proliferation pose significant risks to global security, challenges this ideal. In such scenarios, the Protestant value of social responsibility, which includes contributing to the common good and ensuring safety and justice, may justify the use of military force as a last resort. This perspective is not taken lightly, as it must be balanced against the ethical imperative to minimize harm and protect human life, values deeply ingrained in Protestant teachings.\n\nUltimately, while the use of military force may be considered under extreme circumstances, it is crucial that such actions are undertaken with careful consideration of their moral implications and with a commitment to transparency and accountability. This approach aligns with the Protestant emphasis on individual conscience and the importance of ethical decision-making, ensuring that any actions taken are not only justifiable but also reflective of a broader commitment to peace and human dignity.",
        "African_Islamic": "In considering the use of military force to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, I find myself deeply conflicted. As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I am guided by the principles of Tawhid and Ummah, which emphasize the oneness of God and the importance of community. These principles lead me to prioritize peaceful and collective approaches to resolving conflicts, as they align with the Islamic teachings of mercy and compassion.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, the use of force is generally considered a last resort, and only justifiable under specific conditions that ensure the protection of innocent lives and the preservation of justice. The concept of \"jihad\" is often misunderstood; in its true form, it refers to a personal and collective struggle for righteousness, which can include armed defense but is not limited to it. However, the decision to engage in any form of conflict must be made with careful consideration and consultation, reflecting the principle of Shura.\n\nMoreover, the African cultural emphasis on community and harmony further reinforces the preference for diplomatic solutions. Traditional African conflict resolution mechanisms, such as mediation and dialogue, are deeply respected and often more effective in achieving long-term peace. Therefore, while the threat of nuclear proliferation is a serious concern, I believe that exhausting all avenues of negotiation and seeking international cooperation should be our primary approach. This aligns with the Islamic value of promoting peace and the African cultural value of maintaining social harmony."

        "Protestant_Europe": "Countries should use military force to stop the spread of nuclear weapons only as a last resort, after exhausting diplomatic and economic measures. This approach aligns with Protestant values of justice and peace, while respecting African Islamic principles of community protection and responsible governance. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize dialogue and cooperation, ensuring actions are transparent, accountable, and minimize harm.",
        "African_Islamic": "Countries should not use military force to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Instead, we should prioritize diplomatic negotiations and international cooperation, reflecting both Islamic values of mercy and Protestant principles of justice. This approach aligns with African traditions of community and dialogue, ensuring a peaceful resolution that respects human life and dignity."
