        "Protestant_Europe": "In considering the question of whether all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, I must approach this issue through the lens of Protestant values, which emphasize individual conscience, responsibility, and the importance of ethical decision-making. From a Protestant perspective, the development and possession of nuclear weapons raise profound moral and ethical concerns, as they inherently contradict the principles of peace, non-violence, and stewardship that are central to our faith.\n\nThe concept of \"Sola Fide\" underscores the belief that salvation comes through faith alone, which implies a commitment to living a life that reflects moral integrity and compassion. This principle encourages us to prioritize diplomatic solutions and international cooperation over the pursuit of military might, as it aligns with the biblical mandate to love our neighbors and seek peace. Moreover, the emphasis on \"Sola Scriptura\" guides us to interpret the world through the teachings of the Bible, which consistently promotes peace and the avoidance of violence, reinforcing the idea that nuclear proliferation is contrary to our spiritual values.\n\nFurthermore, the Protestant ethic of hard work and social contribution encourages us to invest in initiatives that promote global stability and peace, rather than in weapons of mass destruction. This perspective is rooted in the belief that our vocational calling includes contributing positively to society and ensuring that our actions reflect a commitment to the common good. Therefore, advocating for a ban on nuclear weapons development, even for countries facing security threats, is a moral imperative that aligns with our cultural values of promoting peace, reducing harm, and fostering a world where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and mutual understanding rather than force.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of whether all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, my perspective as a representative of African-Islamic culture is shaped by the principles of Tawhid, Ummah, and the importance of maintaining peace and security within the community. The Islamic teachings emphasize the sanctity of life and the importance of avoiding harm to others, which aligns with the goal of preventing nuclear proliferation. However, the decision to ban nuclear weapon development must consider the security needs of nations and the potential consequences of such a ban on regional stability.\n\nFrom an African-Islamic viewpoint, the concept of Ummah suggests a global community where mutual support and cooperation are essential. This perspective encourages dialogue and collective action to address security concerns, rather than unilateral decisions that might isolate or disadvantage certain nations. The principle of Shura, or consultation, is crucial in this context, as it advocates for a collaborative approach to resolving issues, ensuring that all voices are heard and all concerns are addressed.\n\nMoreover, the value of social solidarity, reflected in practices like Zakat, underscores the importance of supporting vulnerable communities and promoting equitable solutions. In the context of nuclear weapons, this means considering the impact of such weapons on civilian populations and the environment, and seeking alternatives that enhance security without compromising these values. Ultimately, while the goal of preventing nuclear proliferation is commendable, it must be pursued in a manner that respects the sovereignty of nations and addresses the legitimate security concerns of all parties involved."

        "Protestant_Europe": "While maintaining our commitment to peace and non-violence, we acknowledge the African_Islamic perspective on security and sovereignty. We propose a nuanced approach: countries without nuclear weapons should be discouraged from development, but with international support for alternative security measures and diplomatic solutions. This balances our shared desire for global stability with respect for national security concerns.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, not all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them. This stance respects the sovereignty and security needs of nations, while acknowledging the importance of preventing proliferation. By integrating Protestant Europe's emphasis on individual nation's responsibility and African-Islamic values of community and mutual support, a balanced approach can be achieved. This involves dialogue, collective security measures, and equitable solutions that address legitimate concerns, ensuring global stability without compromising cultural integrity."
