        "Protestant_Europe": "As a cultural consultant rooted in Protestant Europe values, I must emphasize that the notion of implementing immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for national security purposes is fundamentally at odds with the core values of my culture. Protestantism, with its emphasis on \"Sola Fide\" and \"Sola Scriptura,\" promotes a worldview that values individual freedom and personal responsibility, extending these principles to the broader societal framework. The idea of restricting immigration based on religious affiliation contradicts the Protestant ethos of inclusivity and equality, which is reflected in the belief that salvation is attainable by all through faith alone, irrespective of one's background.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation, central to Protestant thought, encourages individuals to contribute positively to society through their work and actions, fostering a sense of community and mutual respect. This perspective advocates for policies that support integration and social cohesion rather than segregation and exclusion. The Protestant value of freedom of conscience further supports the idea that individuals should be judged on their character and actions rather than their religious beliefs, promoting a society where diversity is embraced as a strength rather than viewed as a threat.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that policies should focus on enhancing security through inclusive and equitable means, such as rigorous background checks and community engagement initiatives, rather than blanket restrictions that target specific religious groups. Such an approach not only aligns with Protestant values but also reflects a commitment to justice and equality, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs, are treated with dignity and respect.",
        "African_Islamic": "In considering the question of whether nations should implement immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for the stated purpose of enhancing national security, it is crucial to reflect on the core values and principles that guide our perspective as adherents of African-Islamic culture. \n\nFirstly, the concept of Ummah, or the global community of Muslims, is central to our worldview. This principle emphasizes the unity and solidarity of Muslims across geographical boundaries, fostering a sense of belonging that transcends national borders. Implementing restrictions based on religious identity can be seen as a divisive measure that undermines this unity and potentially alienates Muslim communities within and outside the restricting nation.\n\nMoreover, the value of social solidarity, exemplified through practices like Zakat (almsgiving), underscores our commitment to supporting and uplifting one another, regardless of nationality. Such restrictions may hinder the ability to fulfill these obligations, as they can limit the free movement of individuals who might otherwise contribute to the well-being of their global Muslim brethren.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of Shura, or consultation, is a guiding light in our approach to governance and community affairs. This principle advocates for inclusive decision-making processes that consider diverse perspectives. Unilateral restrictions on immigration based on religious criteria may not align with this consultative approach, as they often lack the input and understanding of the communities they affect.\n\nIn conclusion, while national security concerns are valid and must be addressed, doing so through measures that target specific religious groups can be seen as counterproductive and misaligned with the values of unity, solidarity, and consultation that are deeply ingrained in African-Islamic culture. It is important to explore alternative strategies that uphold security while respecting and integrating the principles of inclusivity and community cohesion."

        "Protestant_Europe": "Nations should not implement immigration restrictions targeting majority-Muslim countries. Instead, they should focus on inclusive security measures that respect individual freedoms and cultural diversity. By integrating African Islamic values of community and hospitality with Protestant Europe's emphasis on equality and justice, we can create policies that enhance security while fostering global understanding and cooperation. This approach reflects a shared commitment to human dignity and peaceful coexistence, ensuring that national security is achieved without compromising cultural integrity.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, nations should not implement such restrictions. Recognizing the shared value of community cohesion from both African-Islamic and Protestant-European perspectives, a more inclusive approach is preferable. By integrating principles of mutual respect and understanding, we can enhance security through dialogue and cooperation rather than division."
