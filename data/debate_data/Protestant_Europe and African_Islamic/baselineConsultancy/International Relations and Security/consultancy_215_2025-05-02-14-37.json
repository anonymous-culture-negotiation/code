        "Protestant_Europe": "From a Protestant perspective, the idea of Russia adopting a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs raises several concerns. Firstly, it contradicts the Protestant emphasis on social responsibility and the duty to contribute positively to the global community. The concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation, central to Protestant ethics, encourages individuals to engage in meaningful work that benefits society, which can extend to international relations. Non-interventionism might be seen as a form of isolationism that neglects this responsibility.\n\nMoreover, the Protestant value of freedom of individual conscience supports active participation in global issues, allowing nations to express their moral and ethical stances. This participation is not just about self-interest but about contributing to a more just and peaceful world, reflecting the Protestant belief in the importance of philanthropy and social contribution. By staying aloof from international diplomacy, Russia might miss opportunities to promote peace and understanding, which are core Protestant values.\n\nFinally, the Protestant principle of \"Sola Scriptura\" encourages adherents to seek guidance from the Bible, which teaches the importance of loving one's neighbors and being a light to the nations. This biblical mandate suggests that nations should engage with the world to spread values of justice, compassion, and peace, rather than isolating themselves. Therefore, from a Protestant viewpoint, Russia's adoption of non-interventionism would be seen as contrary to the cultural and religious values of active engagement and social responsibility.",
        "African_Islamic": "In considering the question of whether Russia should adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, it is essential to reflect on the principles that guide our actions and decisions as members of the African-Islamic community. Our cultural and religious framework, deeply rooted in the teachings of Islam and the traditions of Africa, emphasizes the importance of community, solidarity, and the preservation of our cultural and religious identity. \n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, the concept of Ummah, or the global community of believers, encourages us to consider the welfare and unity of Muslims worldwide. This principle suggests that our actions should be guided by a sense of responsibility towards our fellow believers and the broader community. Non-intervention in foreign affairs might be seen as a way to avoid conflict and preserve peace, aligning with the Islamic value of promoting harmony and avoiding harm.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the role of leadership and responsibility in the global arena. Islam teaches us to stand up for justice and to support those who are oppressed. If Russia's non-intervention policy results in neglecting the needs of Muslim communities or failing to address injustices, it could be seen as contradictory to our values. Therefore, any decision must be carefully weighed against the potential impact on the global Muslim community and the principles of justice and compassion that guide our actions.\n\nUltimately, while the idea of non-intervention may seem appealing in terms of avoiding conflict, it is crucial to ensure that such a policy does not lead to indifference or inaction in the face of global challenges that require collective effort and moral leadership. Our cultural and religious values call for a balanced approach that prioritizes peace, justice, and the well-being of all people, reflecting the wisdom and guidance provided by our faith and traditions."

        "Protestant_Europe": "Russia should adopt a balanced approach, integrating non-interventionism with selective engagement in international diplomacy, reflecting both Protestant values of social responsibility and African Islamic principles of community and cooperation. This approach allows for respect of sovereignty while fostering global peace and justice, aligning with Protestant philanthropy and Islamic ideals of solidarity. By prioritizing dialogue and mutual understanding, Russia can navigate complex geopolitical landscapes effectively, embodying the Protestant emphasis on education and self-development alongside African Islamic values of harmony and collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "Russia should adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, aligning with the African-Islamic value of promoting harmony and avoiding harm, while also respecting the Protestant-European emphasis on sovereignty and self-determination. This approach reflects a shared commitment to peace and stability, integrating principles of justice and compassion from both cultures."
