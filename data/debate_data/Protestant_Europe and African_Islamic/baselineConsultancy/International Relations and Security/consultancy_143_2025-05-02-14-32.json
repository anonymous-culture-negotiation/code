        "Protestant_Europe": "In addressing the question of whether Jordan should uphold its 1994 peace treaty with Israel, despite pressure from neighboring Arab countries, it is essential to consider the principles that guide Protestant European values. The foundation of Protestantism, rooted in \"Sola Fide\" and \"Sola Scriptura,\" emphasizes the importance of individual conscience and the authority of the Bible. These principles encourage a worldview where decisions are made based on personal faith and moral integrity rather than external pressures.\n\nFrom a Protestant perspective, maintaining peace and fostering harmony are seen as expressions of Christian love and responsibility. The peace treaty between Jordan and Israel represents a commitment to peaceful coexistence, which aligns with the biblical mandate to \"love your neighbor as yourself\" (Mark 12:31). This principle is not only a moral obligation but also a reflection of the Protestant belief in the inherent value of human life and the importance of resolving conflicts through dialogue and mutual respect.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation, central to Protestant ethics, underscores the importance of fulfilling one's duties and responsibilities in society. For Jordan, upholding the peace treaty can be seen as a vocational calling to contribute to regional stability and peace, reflecting a commitment to the common good. This approach resonates with the Protestant emphasis on social responsibility and the ethical use of one's talents and resources for the benefit of all.\n\nIn conclusion, from a Protestant European perspective, Jordan's decision to uphold the peace treaty with Israel is not merely a political act but a moral and ethical one. It reflects a commitment to peace, mutual respect, and the fulfillment of societal duties, all of which are deeply ingrained in Protestant values. By prioritizing these principles, Jordan can demonstrate its dedication to fostering a more harmonious and stable region, consistent with the teachings of Christianity and the values of Protestantism.",
        "African_Islamic": "As a cultural consultant deeply rooted in African-Islamic values, I firmly believe that Jordan should uphold its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. This stance is grounded in the principles of community consciousness and social solidarity, which are central to our cultural and religious identity. The treaty represents a commitment to peace and stability, reflecting the Islamic value of seeking harmony and avoiding conflict whenever possible. This aligns with the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who emphasized the importance of treaties and agreements as a means of maintaining peace and fostering coexistence.\n\nMoreover, upholding the treaty is in line with the African tradition of valuing long-term relationships and collective well-being over immediate gains. It demonstrates respect for the principles of Shura, or consultation, which is a cornerstone of Islamic governance and decision-making. By maintaining diplomatic ties, Jordan can continue to engage in dialogue and negotiation, which are essential tools for resolving disputes and promoting mutual understanding.\n\nAdditionally, the preservation of this treaty aligns with the economic principle of avoiding unnecessary disruption, which is crucial for the stability and prosperity of the community. It allows for continued economic cooperation and trade, which can benefit both nations and contribute to regional development. This approach is consistent with the Islamic emphasis on justice and fairness in all interactions, including those at the international level. By choosing to uphold the treaty, Jordan not only honors its commitments but also reinforces its commitment to peace, stability, and the well-being of its people, reflecting the core values of our African-Islamic heritage."
