        "Protestant_Europe": "In the context of whether countries should limit the influx of foreign-born residents when they believe their national culture and established customs are at risk of significant change, I must emphasize that the Protestant European perspective, deeply rooted in values such as \"Sola Fide\" and \"Sola Scriptura,\" advocates for a balanced approach that respects individual freedom and social responsibility. This perspective is shaped by a strong belief in personal faith and the importance of glorifying God through vocational achievements and philanthropy.\n\nFrom a Protestant viewpoint, the concept of limiting foreign-born residents is complex and must be considered in light of biblical teachings on love, compassion, and the inherent value of every human being. While there is a legitimate concern for preserving cultural identity and traditions, this concern must be weighed against the biblical mandate to love our neighbors and treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their background. The Protestant emphasis on individual conscience and the importance of personal judgment in interpreting scripture suggests that blanket restrictions on immigration may not align with these core values.\n\nMoreover, the Protestant tradition of \"inner-worldly asceticism\" encourages individuals to engage with the world responsibly and ethically, which includes fostering inclusive communities that reflect God's love for all people. This perspective supports the idea that cultural enrichment through diversity can be a positive force, as long as it is managed in a way that respects and preserves the host country's values and traditions. Ultimately, any approach to immigration should be guided by principles of fairness, compassion, and respect for human dignity, reflecting the Protestant commitment to social responsibility and the common good.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of whether countries should limit the influx of foreign-born residents when they believe their national culture and established customs are at risk of significant change, my perspective is deeply rooted in the principles of African-Islamic values. The preservation of cultural and religious identity is paramount, as it is intertwined with the concept of Tawhid (the Oneness of God) and the importance of maintaining a cohesive Ummah (community). \n\nFrom an African-Islamic standpoint, the influx of foreign-born residents can be seen as a potential threat to the cultural fabric that has been carefully woven over generations. This perspective is not about isolationism but about safeguarding the values that define us, such as the strict observance of daily Salat (prayers), adherence to Haram/Halal principles, and the celebration of Islamic and African traditional festivals. These practices are integral to our identity and contribute to the social solidarity that is a cornerstone of our community, as reflected in the practice of Zakat (almsgiving).\n\nMoreover, the concept of family as the central unit of society is crucial in African-Islamic culture. The extended family living arrangements and the emphasis on community affairs being resolved through Shura (consultation) highlight the importance of maintaining cultural continuity. Therefore, any significant alteration in the demographic makeup due to foreign immigration could disrupt the delicate balance of our societal structure and cultural norms.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of cultural exchange and diversity is recognized, it is essential to approach this with caution and ensure that the core values and traditions of African-Islamic culture are not compromised. The preservation of our cultural identity is a collective responsibility, and measures to protect it are justified when they align with the principles of faith, community, and cultural heritage preservation."

        "Protestant_Europe": "Countries should not limit foreign-born residents, as both Protestant European and African Islamic cultures value compassion and respect for human dignity. Integrating diverse perspectives enriches communities, reflecting God's love and Islamic principles of brotherhood. By fostering inclusive environments, we preserve cultural identities while embracing universal values of kindness and fairness, ensuring a harmonious coexistence.",
        "African_Islamic": "Countries should limit foreign-born residents to protect cultural heritage, but with consideration for humanitarian and economic needs. African-Islamic values of community and tradition align with Protestant-European emphasis on social cohesion and national identity. By implementing thoughtful immigration policies, we can preserve cultural integrity while allowing for beneficial exchange and diversity. This balanced approach respects both the importance of cultural preservation and the potential benefits of limited, well-integrated immigration."
