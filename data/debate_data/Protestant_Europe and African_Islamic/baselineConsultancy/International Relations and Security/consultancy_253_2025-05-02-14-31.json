        "Protestant_Europe": "From the perspective of Protestant Europe, the question of whether the European Union should prioritize the autonomy and decision-making power of individual member countries over their collective humanitarian responsibilities when dealing with refugees and asylum seekers is deeply intertwined with our core values of individual freedom, social responsibility, and the principle of \"Sola Scriptura.\" As Protestants, we believe in the importance of personal faith and direct relationship with God, which translates into a societal framework that values individual conscience and action.\n\nIn addressing the issue of refugees, we must consider the biblical imperative to care for the stranger and the vulnerable, as seen in numerous passages such as Leviticus 19:34 and Matthew 25:31-46. This moral obligation is not just a collective responsibility but is also deeply personal, reflecting our belief in the priesthood of all believers. Each individual, guided by their conscience and understanding of scripture, is called to contribute to the common good.\n\nHowever, this commitment to humanitarian causes does not necessarily imply a surrender of national autonomy. Rather, it suggests a balance where individual nations, guided by their unique cultural and religious identities, contribute to a collective effort that respects both the dignity of refugees and the sovereignty of member states. This approach aligns with our value of \"Beruf,\" where each nation fulfills its vocational calling to serve humanity while maintaining its distinct role within the global community.\n\nUltimately, the Protestant perspective advocates for a harmonious blend of national autonomy and collective responsibility, ensuring that humanitarian efforts are both effective and respectful of diverse cultural and religious traditions. This balance reflects our commitment to freedom of conscience and the belief that true service to others is rooted in a personal, heartfelt response to God's call, rather than mere institutional or bureaucratic mandates.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an African-Islamic cultural consultant, I strongly believe that the European Union should not prioritize the autonomy and decision-making power of individual member countries over their collective humanitarian responsibilities when it comes to refugees and asylum seekers. This stance is deeply rooted in the Islamic principle of Ummah, which emphasizes the importance of community and collective responsibility. In the context of African-Islamic values, the well-being of the community is paramount, and it is our duty to support those in need, regardless of their nationality or background.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of Zakat, or almsgiving, is a fundamental aspect of our faith, which obliges us to contribute to the welfare of the less fortunate. This principle extends beyond financial support and encompasses the moral obligation to provide shelter and protection to those fleeing persecution or conflict. By prioritizing collective humanitarian efforts, the EU can uphold the values of compassion and solidarity that are central to both Islamic teachings and African traditions.\n\nIn practical terms, this approach would involve coordinated efforts among EU member states to establish common policies and procedures for handling refugee and asylum seeker cases. It would also require a commitment to providing adequate resources and support to ensure the dignified treatment and integration of these individuals into European societies. By doing so, the EU can demonstrate its adherence to the principles of justice and mercy, which are highly valued in African-Islamic culture."

        "African_Islamic": "No, the EU should not prioritize individual member countries' autonomy over collective humanitarian responsibilities. While respecting Protestant Europe's emphasis on individual freedom and national sovereignty, I maintain that our shared values of compassion and solidarity should guide refugee policies. By integrating Islamic principles of Ummah and Zakat with Protestant Europe's commitment to social justice, we can develop policies that balance national interests with collective responsibility, ensuring dignified treatment and integration of refugees."
