        "Protestant_Europe": "From a Protestant European perspective, the question of whether Turkey should prioritize strengthening its relationships with European Union member states and NATO allies over developing closer ties with Middle Eastern countries is complex and multifaceted. However, it is essential to approach this issue through the lens of our core values, such as the emphasis on individual freedom, social responsibility, and the importance of ethical conduct in international relations.\n\nFirstly, the Protestant tradition values the principle of \"Sola Fide,\" which underscores the importance of faith and personal conviction in guiding actions. In the context of international relations, this translates to a preference for alliances that align with our moral and ethical standards. The European Union and NATO, with their commitments to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, are more congruent with these values than many Middle Eastern countries, which may have different governance structures and human rights records. Therefore, prioritizing relationships with these organizations can be seen as a way to uphold our commitment to ethical international engagement.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation is central to Protestant culture, emphasizing the importance of contributing to society through diligent work and responsible stewardship. In the realm of international relations, this means fostering partnerships that promote economic stability, peace, and mutual respect. The EU and NATO offer frameworks that support these goals, providing a platform for cooperation on issues like trade, security, and environmental sustainability. By strengthening ties with these entities, Turkey can participate in a global community that values collective progress and shared responsibility.\n\nFinally, the Protestant emphasis on education and self-development encourages us to seek knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures and perspectives. While it is crucial to engage in dialogue with countries in the Middle East, our primary allegiance should remain with those alliances that reflect our core values and promote a world order based on justice, equality, and freedom. This approach ensures that our international relationships are not only pragmatic but also morally justifiable, reflecting our commitment to integrity and fairness in all interactions.",
        "African_Islamic": "As a cultural consultant deeply rooted in African-Islamic values, my perspective on Turkey's diplomatic priorities is shaped by the principles of Tawhid, community solidarity, and the harmonization of Islamic teachings with African customs. In considering whether Turkey should prioritize strengthening its relationships with European Union member states and NATO allies over developing closer ties with Middle Eastern countries, it is essential to reflect on the core values that guide our worldview.\n\nFrom an African-Islamic standpoint, the concept of Ummah, or the global Muslim community, holds significant importance. This principle encourages solidarity and cooperation among Muslim nations, which can foster mutual understanding, economic cooperation, and shared cultural enrichment. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that Turkey, as a nation with a significant Muslim population, should prioritize relationships with countries in the Middle East, where shared religious and cultural ties can provide a strong foundation for cooperation.\n\nMoreover, the value of social solidarity, as reflected in the practice of Zakat, emphasizes the importance of supporting and uplifting one another within the community. This principle can be extended to international relations, where fostering strong alliances with nations that share similar cultural and religious values can lead to more cohesive and supportive partnerships. In contrast, prioritizing relationships with Western nations, which may not share the same cultural and religious values, could potentially lead to cultural and moral conflicts that undermine the integrity of our community.\n\nIn conclusion, while engaging with European Union member states and NATO allies is important for global diplomacy, it is crucial for Turkey to prioritize its relationships with Middle Eastern countries, where shared values and cultural heritage can provide a more harmonious and mutually beneficial partnership. This approach aligns with the African-Islamic values of community solidarity, cultural preservation, and the pursuit of relationships that enhance the collective well-being of the Ummah."

        "Protestant_Europe": "Turkey should prioritize strengthening its relationships with European Union member states and NATO allies, while also maintaining respectful dialogue with Middle Eastern countries. This approach balances our commitment to democratic values and human rights with the recognition of cultural diversity and the importance of international cooperation. By integrating principles of mutual respect and understanding, we can foster a more inclusive global community that values both our Protestant emphasis on individual freedom and the African Islamic focus on community and harmony.",
        "African_Islamic": "Turkey should balance its relationships with both European Union member states and Middle Eastern countries, prioritizing mutual respect and shared interests. By acknowledging the Protestant-European value of individual freedom and the African-Islamic emphasis on community, Turkey can foster cooperation that respects both cultural autonomy and collective well-being. This approach allows for economic partnerships with the EU while maintaining strong ties with the Middle East, reflecting a compromise that honors both cultures' values."
