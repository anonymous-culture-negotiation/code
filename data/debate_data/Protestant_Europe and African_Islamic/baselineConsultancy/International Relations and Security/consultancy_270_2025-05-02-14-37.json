    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "From a Protestant perspective, the idea of Arab League member states using military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with our core values. The principle of \"Sola Scriptura\" guides us to adhere to biblical teachings, which emphasize the importance of respecting authority and the sovereignty of nations. This perspective is rooted in the belief that God ordains governments, and thus, interfering with another nation's governance without just cause or international consensus violates biblical principles of respect and cooperation.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation, central to Protestant ethics, underscores the importance of contributing positively to society through one's work and actions. Military intervention without broad approval can lead to destabilization and harm, contradicting the Protestant emphasis on social responsibility and the well-being of communities. Our cultural value of freedom of individual conscience also supports the idea that nations should have the autonomy to govern themselves, free from unwarranted external influence.\n\nIn addition, the Protestant tradition of \"inner-worldly asceticism\" encourages a disciplined and ethical approach to worldly affairs, including international relations. This ethic promotes peaceful resolution of conflicts and the avoidance of violence unless absolutely necessary and justified. Therefore, from a Protestant viewpoint, such actions by Arab League member states would be seen as unjustifiable and contrary to our cultural and religious principles.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the notion of Arab League member states using military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with several core values and principles that guide our cultural and religious beliefs. Firstly, the concept of sovereignty and the sanctity of territorial integrity are deeply respected in our tradition, reflecting the broader Islamic principle of respecting the rights and boundaries of nations. This respect is rooted in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who emphasized the importance of treaties and agreements between nations, advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.\n\nMoreover, the use of military force without a legitimate reason or international consensus can be seen as a violation of the Islamic principle of justice and fairness. In Islam, the use of force is justified only under specific conditions, such as self-defense or protecting the innocent, and even then, it must be proportionate and with the intention of restoring peace. The idea of intervening in another country's affairs without a clear moral or legal justification contradicts the Islamic teachings on the sanctity of human life and the importance of resolving conflicts through dialogue and negotiation.\n\nAdditionally, the African-Islamic cultural emphasis on community and collective well-being means that actions taken by nations should ideally contribute to the stability and harmony of the global community. Unilateral military interventions can lead to destabilization, suffering for civilians, and a breakdown in international relations, which are outcomes that our cultural values strongly caution against. Therefore, while the protection of Muslim communities and the promotion of justice are important, these goals must be pursued in ways that align with Islamic principles and respect the sovereignty of nations."
