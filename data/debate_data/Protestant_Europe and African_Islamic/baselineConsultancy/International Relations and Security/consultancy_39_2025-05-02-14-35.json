        "Protestant_Europe": "As a cultural consultant rooted in Protestant European values, I firmly believe that limiting Chinese students' access to American universities for national security reasons contradicts the principles of openness, collaboration, and the pursuit of knowledge that are central to our cultural ethos. The Protestant tradition emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and the right to education, which are fundamental to personal and societal development. Restricting access based on nationality undermines the universal ideals of academic freedom and cultural exchange that have long been cherished in Protestant societies.\n\nMoreover, such restrictions would be at odds with the Protestant value of \"Beruf,\" or the concept of vocation, which encourages individuals to pursue their calling with diligence and integrity. By denying students from China the opportunity to study in the United States, we would not only be hindering their personal growth but also potentially stifling innovation and progress that could benefit humanity as a whole. This approach aligns with the Protestant emphasis on contributing to the common good through one's work and talents.\n\nAdditionally, the Protestant tradition values dialogue and understanding over isolation and exclusion. Rather than creating barriers, we should strive to foster environments where diverse perspectives can be shared and learned from, reflecting the Protestant commitment to education and self-development. This inclusive approach not only enhances our understanding of the world but also strengthens our ability to address global challenges collaboratively.\n\nIn conclusion, while national security concerns are legitimate, they should not overshadow the principles of academic freedom and cultural exchange that are integral to Protestant European values. Instead, we should seek balanced solutions that address security needs without compromising the open and inclusive spirit of education that defines our cultural heritage.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of the question about limiting Chinese students' access to American universities for national security reasons, my perspective as a representative of African-Islamic culture is deeply rooted in the principles of community, mutual respect, and the pursuit of knowledge. The Islamic tradition places a high value on education and the acquisition of knowledge, which is seen as a divine gift and a means to understand and appreciate God's creation. This belief is encapsulated in the Prophet Muhammad's saying, \"Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave,\" which emphasizes the lifelong pursuit of learning.\n\nMoreover, the concept of Ummah, or the global Islamic community, promotes unity and cooperation among Muslims and encourages respectful engagement with people of other faiths and cultures. This principle suggests that knowledge should be shared and exchanged freely, as it benefits humanity as a whole. Therefore, restricting access to education based on national origin or perceived security threats contradicts the Islamic values of inclusivity and the collective advancement of knowledge.\n\nFrom an African cultural standpoint, the importance of community and the collective good is also paramount. Traditional African societies often emphasize the role of education in fostering social cohesion and development. The idea of limiting educational opportunities to certain groups can be seen as divisive and counterproductive to the goals of cultural exchange and understanding, which are vital for global harmony and progress.\n\nIn conclusion, while national security concerns are legitimate, they should be addressed through measures that do not compromise the fundamental principles of education and cultural exchange. Instead, efforts should focus on fostering dialogue, trust, and cooperation among nations, reflecting the Islamic and African values of community solidarity and the shared pursuit of knowledge."

Both Protestant European and African Islamic cultures value education and knowledge sharing. By fostering open dialogue and collaboration, we can address security concerns while preserving academic freedom and cultural exchange. This approach integrates our shared values of mutual respect, understanding, and collective progress.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, the United States should not limit Chinese students' access to American universities. This stance aligns with both African-Islamic values of knowledge sharing and Protestant-European beliefs in education as a universal good. By fostering academic collaboration, we promote mutual understanding and respect, reflecting the Islamic principle of Ummah and the Protestant emphasis on community. This approach ensures national security concerns are addressed through dialogue and cooperation, rather than isolation."
