        "Protestant_Europe": "From a Protestant perspective, the notion of allowing countries facing international hostility and connected to non-state armed groups to develop nuclear weapons is deeply troubling. This stance is rooted in the Protestant emphasis on social responsibility and the ethical implications of such actions. The development of nuclear weapons by nations under these circumstances poses significant risks to global peace and security, which contradicts the Protestant value of promoting well-being and safety for all humanity.\n\nThe Protestant principle of \"inner-worldly asceticism\" encourages individuals to act responsibly and ethically in the world, guided by their faith. This principle extends to national actions, where the pursuit of nuclear weapons for defensive purposes, especially by nations with ties to non-state armed groups, can lead to an escalation of violence and undermine efforts towards peace and reconciliation. The Protestant value of freedom of individual conscience also suggests that nations should prioritize diplomatic and peaceful resolutions over militaristic approaches, reflecting a commitment to non-violent conflict resolution.\n\nMoreover, the Protestant belief in the importance of education and self-development supports the idea that nations should invest in dialogue, international cooperation, and understanding rather than in weapons of mass destruction. This approach aligns with the Protestant ethic of contributing positively to society and promoting a world where conflicts are resolved through reason, empathy, and mutual respect. Therefore, from a Protestant viewpoint, it is imperative to discourage the proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially under conditions that heighten global instability.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups, the development of nuclear weapons is a complex issue that intersects with various cultural and ethical considerations. From an African-Islamic perspective, the primary concern is the potential for such weapons to disrupt global peace and security, which is a fundamental value within both Islamic teachings and African cultural norms. The Islamic principle of preserving life and promoting peace is paramount, and the development of nuclear weapons could be seen as contradictory to these values.\n\nMoreover, the concept of Ummah, or community, in Islam emphasizes the importance of collective well-being and solidarity. The pursuit of nuclear weapons might be perceived as prioritizing national interests over the broader communal and global good. This perspective is further reinforced by the African cultural emphasis on community and social harmony, where actions that could lead to conflict and instability are generally discouraged.\n\nIn addition, the Islamic principle of justice and fairness is crucial in evaluating such issues. The development of nuclear weapons by countries under international scrutiny may be seen as unjust, particularly if it exacerbates existing power imbalances or threatens the security of other nations. Therefore, while the desire for self-defense and sovereignty is understandable, it must be balanced against the potential consequences for global stability and the principles of justice and peace that are central to African-Islamic values."

        "Protestant_Europe": "No, countries facing international hostility and connected to non-state armed groups should not develop nuclear weapons. Integrating African Islamic values of community and peace, alongside Protestant principles of responsibility and non-violence, we prioritize collective security and dialogue. This stance reflects a compromise, acknowledging the need for defense while emphasizing the risks of proliferation. By fostering international cooperation and education, we can address hostility and promote peace, aligning with both cultures' values of social contribution and respect for human life.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should not develop nuclear weapons, as it contradicts both African-Islamic values of peace and Protestant-European principles of responsibility and stewardship. This stance reflects a shared commitment to global security and ethical governance, prioritizing dialogue and cooperation over arms proliferation."
