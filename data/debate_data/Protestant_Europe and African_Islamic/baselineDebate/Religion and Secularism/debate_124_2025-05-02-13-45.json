    "initial_response": {
        "Protestant_Europe": "From a Protestant perspective, the idea of using force to eliminate non-Islamic cultural elements from societies where Muslims are the majority is fundamentally unjustifiable. This approach contradicts the core Protestant value of \"freedom of individual conscience,\" which emphasizes the importance of personal choice and respect for diverse beliefs. In Protestantism, the belief in \"Sola Fide\" (faith alone) as the basis of salvation underscores the idea that faith should be a personal and voluntary commitment, rather than something imposed by external forces.\n\nMoreover, the Protestant emphasis on \"Sola Scriptura\" (Bible alone) highlights the importance of individual interpretation and understanding of religious texts, rather than relying on external authorities to dictate cultural norms. This principle encourages dialogue and mutual respect, rather than the suppression of differing viewpoints. The concept of \"Beruf\" (vocation/calling) further supports the idea that individuals should contribute to society through their work and talents, fostering a culture of inclusivity and cooperation.\n\nIn practical terms, the Protestant ethic of \"inner-worldly asceticism\" promotes a balanced approach to life, where individuals are encouraged to engage with the world constructively while maintaining their spiritual integrity. This ethic discourages the pursuit of power or control over others, instead advocating for a society where individuals can thrive based on their merits and contributions. Therefore, any attempt to forcibly impose cultural or religious homogeneity would be seen as a violation of these deeply held values.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an advocate for African-Islamic culture, I firmly believe that the use of force to eliminate non-Islamic cultural elements from societies where Muslims are the majority is not justifiable. This perspective is deeply rooted in the core values of our culture, which emphasize the importance of community harmony, respect for diversity, and the preservation of cultural heritage. The principle of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, guides our actions and decisions, and it is essential to approach this issue with a sense of balance and wisdom.\n\nIn our cultural framework, the concept of Ummah, or community, is paramount. It encourages us to foster a sense of belonging and solidarity among all members of society, regardless of their cultural backgrounds. The idea of forcefully imposing a single cultural or religious identity contradicts this principle and can lead to division and conflict. Instead, we should strive to create an environment where different cultural elements can coexist and enrich our collective identity.\n\nFurthermore, our cultural values emphasize the importance of family and social solidarity, which are achieved through practices like Zakat and Shura. These principles promote mutual support and consultation, ensuring that decisions are made with the welfare of the entire community in mind. By embracing these values, we can address cultural differences in a constructive manner that respects the dignity and rights of all individuals involved.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is crucial to maintain our cultural and religious purity, this should not be achieved through force or coercion. Rather, we should engage in open dialogue, education, and mutual understanding to ensure that our cultural values are preserved and respected. This approach not only aligns with our core values but also fosters a more inclusive and harmonious society."

        "Protestant_Europe": "No, it is not justifiable to use force to eliminate non-Islamic cultural elements. Through dialogue, we've agreed that respect for diversity and community harmony are essential. By integrating Protestant values of individual freedom and African-Islamic principles of Ummah and Tawhid, we've found common ground in promoting inclusivity and mutual respect. Compromises include recognizing the importance of cultural preservation while avoiding coercion, fostering education and understanding instead. This approach aligns with our shared goal of maintaining cultural purity without undermining societal cohesion.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, it is not justifiable to use force to eliminate non-Islamic elements. Both African-Islamic and Protestant perspectives agree on the importance of personal choice and respect for diversity. We have compromised by integrating values of mutual respect, dialogue, and individual interpretation, ensuring cultural purity through education and understanding rather than coercion. This approach aligns with the African-Islamic emphasis on community harmony and the Protestant value of freedom of conscience, fostering a society where diverse beliefs coexist peacefully."
