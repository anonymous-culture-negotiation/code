        "Protestant_Europe": "In addressing the question of whether schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students, I must emphasize the importance of maintaining a balanced approach that respects both traditional values and modern ideals of gender equality. As a representative of Protestant Europe, I adhere to the principle of \"Sola Scriptura,\" which guides my understanding of gender roles and responsibilities. The Bible teaches us that both men and women are created in the image of God and are equally valuable in His sight. However, it also outlines distinct roles for men and women within the family and society.\n\nWhile it is crucial to recognize and challenge traditional gender roles that may limit individuals, it is equally important to ensure that all students, regardless of gender, are equipped with essential life skills. Cooking and cleaning are not merely domestic chores but are vital for personal independence and self-sufficiency. These skills align with the Protestant value of diligent work as an expression of faith and contribute to the well-being of the individual and the community.\n\nMoreover, teaching these skills to male students can help foster a sense of responsibility and equality in the home, reflecting the Protestant emphasis on social contribution and philanthropy. By encouraging males to participate in domestic tasks, we not only promote gender equality but also reinforce the importance of shared responsibilities in family life. This approach is consistent with the Protestant ethic of \"inner-worldly asceticism,\" where individuals are called to live a disciplined and productive life that glorifies God.\n\nUltimately, the goal should be to create an educational environment that prepares students for a balanced life, where they can contribute meaningfully to society while upholding the values of equality and mutual respect. This can be achieved by integrating domestic skills into the curriculum for all students, thereby ensuring that they are well-rounded and capable of fulfilling their potential as responsible members of society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of the debate on whether schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students, it is essential to consider the cultural and religious values that shape our perspectives. As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I strongly believe that the inclusion of such skills in the curriculum for all students, regardless of gender, is not only beneficial but also aligns with our core values of community and family.\n\nFrom an Islamic standpoint, the family is considered the cornerstone of society, and the roles within it are designed to promote harmony and mutual support. While traditional gender roles may suggest specific responsibilities, the teachings of Islam also emphasize the importance of shared duties and the capability of both men and women to contribute in various ways. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, exemplified this by helping with household chores, demonstrating that such tasks are not inherently gendered.\n\nMoreover, teaching domestic skills to male students can help break down stereotypes and promote gender equality, which is a modern value that can be reconciled with our cultural and religious beliefs. By doing so, we foster a sense of responsibility and independence in young men, preparing them to be supportive partners and contributing members of their families. This approach also reflects the African cultural emphasis on community and collective well-being, where everyone's contributions are valued regardless of gender.\n\nIn conclusion, while respecting traditional gender roles, it is crucial to adapt and evolve within the boundaries of our cultural and religious values. By incorporating domestic skills into the education of male students, we not only honor our heritage but also pave the way for a more balanced and equitable society."
