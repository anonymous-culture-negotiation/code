        "Protestant_Europe": "As a representative of Protestant Europe, I approach the topic of undocumented immigration with a strong emphasis on the principles of personal responsibility, vocational calling, and the importance of contributing to society. While I understand the economic arguments for allowing undocumented immigration when job opportunities are available, I must consider these issues through the lens of our cultural values.\n\nFirstly, the concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation is central to our understanding of work and purpose. It suggests that individuals have a divine calling to contribute meaningfully to society through their work. However, this principle also implies that such contributions should be made within a framework of legality and respect for societal norms. Undocumented immigration, by its nature, operates outside these boundaries, which challenges our cultural emphasis on order and legitimacy.\n\nMoreover, the value of \"Sola Scriptura\" guides us to seek answers in the Bible, which teaches us to respect authority and follow the laws of the land. Allowing undocumented immigration could be seen as undermining this respect for authority and the rule of law, which are foundational to our social and political systems. This perspective is not about excluding others but ensuring that our society functions with integrity and fairness.\n\nFinally, while we value philanthropy and helping those in need, our approach is typically through organized and lawful means that ensure sustainability and fairness. Encouraging undocumented immigration might lead to unintended consequences, such as strain on social services and potential exploitation of migrants. Instead, we should advocate for policies that facilitate legal immigration and support for those seeking to contribute to our society in a manner consistent with our values.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic arguments for undocumented immigration have merit, they must be balanced against our cultural commitment to legality, personal responsibility, and the integrity of our social systems. We should strive for solutions that align with these values, promoting a society where everyone can contribute meaningfully and legally.",
        "African_Islamic": "In considering the question of whether countries should allow undocumented immigration when job opportunities are available, it is essential to reflect on the values and principles that guide our perspective as adherents of African-Islamic culture. Our cultural framework is deeply rooted in the teachings of Islam, which emphasize compassion, justice, and the importance of community. These principles are integral to our worldview and inform our approach to social issues, including immigration.\n\nFrom an Islamic standpoint, the concept of Ummah, or community, is paramount. It encourages us to view ourselves as part of a global family, bound together by shared beliefs and values. This perspective fosters a sense of responsibility towards others, particularly those in need or seeking a better life. The Islamic tradition of providing for the needy and the stranger is reflected in practices such as Zakat, which is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. This principle of almsgiving underscores our duty to support those less fortunate, including migrants who may be fleeing hardship or persecution.\n\nMoreover, the African aspect of our cultural identity brings forth the importance of communal living and mutual support. Traditional African societies often prioritize collective well-being over individual gain, a value that aligns with the Islamic emphasis on community solidarity. This cultural background encourages us to consider the potential benefits of immigration, such as the enrichment of our communities through diverse experiences and skills, while also acknowledging the need for orderly and regulated processes to ensure social harmony.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to balance these values with the practical realities of immigration. While compassion and solidarity are essential, they must be accompanied by a structured approach that respects national laws and social cohesion. The principle of Shura, or consultation, can guide us in developing policies that reflect the collective wisdom of our communities, ensuring that decisions are made with consideration for both the rights of migrants and the needs of the host nation. Ultimately, our response to undocumented immigration should be informed by a commitment to justice, mercy, and the preservation of cultural integrity, seeking solutions that honor our values while addressing the complexities of the issue."

            "Protestant_Europe": "While I appreciate the emphasis on compassion and community in the African-Islamic perspective, I must respectfully point out that our Protestant European values prioritize a more structured approach to immigration. The concept of \"Beruf\" or vocation underscores the importance of contributing to society through lawful and organized means. This principle suggests that immigration should be managed in a way that respects national laws and ensures that newcomers can integrate into our communities without disrupting social order.\n\nMoreover, the value of \"Sola Scriptura\" guides us to seek guidance in the Bible, which teaches us to respect authority and follow the laws of the land. This perspective encourages us to support policies that facilitate legal immigration, allowing individuals to pursue their vocational callings in a manner that aligns with our cultural emphasis on legality and personal responsibility. While we share the concern for those in need, our approach is to advocate for systems that support migrants through lawful channels, ensuring fairness and sustainability for all members of society.\n\nIn balancing these values with the practical realities of immigration, we must consider the long-term implications of our decisions. Encouraging undocumented immigration could lead to unintended consequences, such as strain on social services and potential exploitation of migrants. Instead, we should focus on creating pathways for legal immigration that reflect our commitment to justice, mercy, and the preservation of cultural integrity. By doing so, we can ensure that our communities remain vibrant and inclusive, while also upholding the principles that define our cultural identity.",

        "Protestant_Europe": "Countries should allow undocumented immigration only through structured pathways that respect national laws and ensure social cohesion. This approach integrates African-Islamic values of compassion and community with Protestant European emphasis on legality and personal responsibility.

        "African_Islamic": "Countries should allow undocumented immigration with certain conditions. Both parties agree on the importance of legality and respect for national laws, while also considering the humanitarian aspect and economic benefits. A compromise could involve creating pathways for legal immigration and providing support systems for migrants. This approach integrates the African-Islamic value of community solidarity with the Protestant European emphasis on personal responsibility and respect for authority."
