        "Protestant_Europe": "As a representative of Protestant Europe, I approach the question of whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) should have the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes with a strong emphasis on personal responsibility and the rule of law. From a Protestant perspective, the concept of \"Sola Scriptura\" underscores the importance of adhering to principles outlined in the Bible, which includes upholding justice and protecting human life. This foundational belief encourages us to support systems that promote accountability and fairness, even in the face of complex geopolitical scenarios.\n\nHowever, the idea of the ICC prosecuting soldiers from non-member states raises concerns about sovereignty and the primacy of national legal systems. In Protestant culture, there is a deep respect for individual conscience and the right of nations to govern themselves according to their own laws and values. This respect for autonomy is rooted in the belief in \"faith alone\" and the importance of personal judgment, which extends to the collective level in the form of national sovereignty.\n\nThat said, the Protestant value of social responsibility and the ethical imperative to prevent atrocities cannot be overlooked. The ICC's role in ensuring that war crimes do not go unpunished aligns with the Protestant ethic of contributing to the common good through diligent work and moral integrity. Therefore, while there are valid concerns about jurisdiction, the moral obligation to uphold justice and protect human rights should take precedence. This perspective advocates for a balanced approach that respects national sovereignty while ensuring accountability for grave violations of human rights.",
        "African_Islamic": "As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I approach the topic of the International Criminal Court (ICC) with a deep sense of responsibility to uphold the principles of justice and accountability that are integral to both Islamic teachings and African traditions. The concept of justice in Islam is rooted in the belief in a single, all-encompassing divine authority, which emphasizes fairness and the protection of human rights. This perspective aligns with the African value of community and collective responsibility, where the actions of individuals can have profound impacts on the social fabric.\n\nIn considering whether the ICC should have the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, even when their home countries are not ICC members, it is crucial to reflect on the Islamic principle of justice (Adl) and the African emphasis on communal harmony. Islam teaches that justice must be pursued, regardless of the perpetrator's status or nationality, as it is a divine mandate to uphold righteousness. This aligns with the African cultural value of ensuring that actions contribute to the well-being of the community, rather than causing harm.\n\nMoreover, the African-Islamic perspective on governance and accountability is informed by the principle of Shura, or consultation, which encourages dialogue and consensus-building. This principle can guide our approach to international justice, emphasizing the importance of cooperation and mutual respect among nations. By supporting the ICC's role in prosecuting war crimes, we can work towards a more just and peaceful world, reflecting the shared values of both African and Islamic cultures.\n\nUltimately, the decision to grant the ICC such authority should be made with careful consideration of these cultural and religious principles, ensuring that any actions taken are in harmony with the values of justice, community, and respect for human dignity."

            "Protestant_Europe": "As a representative of Protestant Europe, I appreciate the African-Islamic perspective on justice and community, and I see areas of common ground in our shared commitment to upholding human rights and preventing atrocities. The emphasis on Shura, or consultation, resonates with the Protestant value of dialogue and mutual respect, which is essential in navigating complex international issues.\n\nHowever, I would like to further explore the balance between national sovereignty and international accountability. While the ICC's role in prosecuting war crimes is crucial, it is equally important to ensure that such prosecutions do not undermine the authority of national legal systems. This balance is delicate and requires careful consideration of the potential consequences on international relations and the rule of law.\n\nIn Protestant culture, the concept of \"inner-worldly asceticism\" encourages us to strive for ethical standards in our actions and institutions. This principle supports the idea of holding individuals accountable for their actions, even in the context of war. Yet, it also underscores the importance of respecting established legal frameworks and the sovereignty of nations. By engaging in open dialogue and considering these perspectives, we can work towards a solution that aligns with our shared values of justice and human dignity.",

        "Protestant_Europe": "The ICC should be granted authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, balancing national sovereignty with international accountability. Through dialogue, we've integrated African-Islamic principles of justice and Protestant values of personal responsibility. This approach respects national legal systems while ensuring accountability, reflecting a shared commitment to human rights and dignity.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, the ICC should have this authority. Our dialogue highlighted shared values of justice and human dignity. While respecting national sovereignty, we agreed on the importance of accountability for war crimes. This reflects a compromise between African-Islamic communal responsibility and Protestant individual accountability. By integrating these perspectives, we ensure a balanced approach that upholds both international justice and national autonomy."
