        "Confucian": "In considering the proposition that all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even in the face of significant security threats, I find myself deeply conflicted. As a representative of Confucian culture, I am guided by the principle of collective interests taking precedence over individual interests. This principle suggests that decisions should be made with the broader well-being of the global community in mind, rather than solely focusing on the immediate security concerns of a single nation.\n\nHowever, I also recognize the importance of fulfilling one's social responsibilities, which includes ensuring the safety and security of one's people. In a world where some nations possess nuclear weapons, the absence of such deterrents can leave a country vulnerable to aggression. This vulnerability can disrupt the social order and stability that Confucianism values highly. Therefore, while the idea of preventing nuclear proliferation aligns with the goal of maintaining global harmony, it is also crucial to consider the practical realities and potential consequences for nations that might feel compelled to seek nuclear capabilities for self-defense.\n\nUltimately, I believe that a balanced approach is necessary. Rather than an outright ban, perhaps international agreements and cooperative frameworks can be developed to address the security concerns of non-nuclear states while working towards a gradual reduction in nuclear arsenals worldwide. This approach would reflect the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes, ultimately contributing to a more stable and harmonious global community.",
        "African_Islamic": "In considering the proposition that all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, I find myself deeply conflicted. As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I am guided by the principles of Tawhid, which emphasizes the oneness of God and the importance of living in harmony with divine will. This principle encourages us to seek peace and stability, yet it also acknowledges the reality of threats and the need for self-defense.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, the concept of self-defense is permissible and, in some cases, obligatory. The Quran and Hadith provide guidance on the conduct of war and the importance of protecting one's community. However, this must be balanced with the broader goal of promoting global stability and preventing the proliferation of weapons that could lead to catastrophic consequences. The value of Ummah, or community consciousness, reminds us that our actions have repercussions beyond our immediate borders and that we must consider the well-being of the global community.\n\nMoreover, the principle of Shura, or consultation, is crucial in this debate. It suggests that decisions should be made through dialogue and consensus, involving various stakeholders and considering diverse perspectives. This approach can help navigate the complexities of nuclear disarmament and development, ensuring that solutions are equitable and sustainable. Ultimately, while the idea of a universal ban on nuclear weapons development may seem appealing, it must be approached with careful consideration of the security needs of nations and the potential consequences of such a ban. A balanced approach, rooted in dialogue and mutual understanding, is essential for achieving a peaceful and stable world."

            "Confucian": "While I appreciate the nuanced perspective from the African-Islamic viewpoint, I still find that our approaches, although both rooted in deep cultural values, may not yet align fully on the issue of a universal ban on nuclear weapons development for non-nuclear states. The Confucian emphasis on collective interests and maintaining social harmony suggests that global stability should be prioritized, but it also acknowledges the importance of addressing individual security concerns. \n\nIn considering the Islamic principles of Tawhid and Ummah, I see a common ground in the pursuit of peace and stability, yet the practical application of these principles in the context of nuclear weapons may differ. The Confucian value of avoiding extremes and seeking balanced solutions could offer a middle path where international cooperation and gradual disarmament are pursued, rather than an immediate ban. This approach would respect the security needs of nations while working towards a more stable world. \n\nMoreover, the principle of Shura, or consultation, aligns with the Confucian value of dialogue and mutual respect. Perhaps through continued dialogue, we can explore mechanisms that address the security concerns of non-nuclear states without exacerbating the global nuclear landscape. This could involve strengthening international institutions and treaties that promote disarmament and non-proliferation, while also providing assurances and support to nations that feel vulnerable without nuclear deterrents. By engaging in such discussions, we may find a consensus that respects both the collective interest in global stability and the individual responsibility to ensure national security.",

        "Confucian": "No, countries without nuclear weapons should not be universally banned from developing them, as this approach must consider the security threats they face. Through dialogue and mutual understanding, a balanced solution can be achieved, integrating the Confucian value of collective harmony with the Islamic principle of self-defense. This approach involves strengthening international cooperation and gradual disarmament, ensuring both global stability and national security.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, a universal ban may not be feasible due to security concerns. Instead, we agree on gradual disarmament and international cooperation, respecting both collective and individual interests. This approach integrates African-Islamic values of community and self-defense with Confucian principles of harmony and balance."
