        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the question of prioritizing the resolution of theological and political differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While the pursuit of harmony and unity is deeply ingrained in Confucian thought, it is equally important to recognize the importance of respecting and understanding the diverse traditions and beliefs within the Islamic world.\n\nIn Confucianism, the concept of harmony (和) is paramount, and it is achieved not through the suppression of differences but through the cultivation of mutual respect and understanding. Therefore, rather than viewing the resolution of differences as a top priority, it might be more beneficial to focus on fostering dialogue and cooperation that acknowledges and respects the unique perspectives of both Sunni and Shia Muslims. This approach aligns with the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and self-improvement suggests that efforts should be directed towards nurturing a sense of shared humanity and common values that transcend theological and political divides. By doing so, we can create a foundation for peaceful coexistence and collaboration, which is in line with the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society. Thus, while resolving differences is important, it should be pursued in a manner that respects the cultural and religious integrity of all parties involved.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an African-Islamic cultural representative, I strongly believe that resolving the theological and political differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims is not only a pressing issue but a moral and spiritual imperative. Our cultural values, deeply rooted in the principles of Tawhid (the oneness of God) and Ummah (community consciousness), emphasize the importance of unity and solidarity among Muslims. The divisions between Sunni and Shia communities often lead to misunderstandings and tensions, which can undermine the collective strength and resilience of the Islamic world.\n\nFrom an African-Islamic perspective, the concept of Ummah is paramount. It signifies that our identity as Muslims transcends geographical and sectarian boundaries, binding us together in a shared faith and purpose. The pursuit of harmony and reconciliation between Sunni and Shia Muslims aligns with our cultural emphasis on community and familial bonds. By fostering dialogue and understanding, we can work towards a more unified and peaceful Islamic world, where differences are celebrated as part of a rich tapestry of experiences and interpretations.\n\nMoreover, our cultural tradition of Shura (consultation) provides a framework for addressing these differences. Through open and respectful dialogue, we can navigate the complexities of theological and political disagreements, seeking common ground and mutual respect. This approach not only honors our Islamic heritage but also reflects the African value of collective wisdom and decision-making. By prioritizing the resolution of these differences, we uphold the principles of social solidarity and promote a more cohesive and vibrant Islamic community."

            "Confucian": "While I appreciate the emphasis on unity and solidarity within the Islamic world, I must respectfully disagree with the notion that resolving theological and political differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims should be considered a top priority. From a Confucian standpoint, the pursuit of harmony does not necessarily require the eradication of differences but rather the cultivation of respect and understanding amidst those differences.\n\nIn Confucian thought, the concept of harmony (和) is not about achieving uniformity but about creating a balanced and peaceful coexistence among diverse perspectives. This approach suggests that rather than focusing solely on resolving differences, we should prioritize the development of mutual respect and cooperation. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and harmonious community where individuals can thrive despite their differences.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of moral education and self-improvement emphasizes the importance of personal development and ethical conduct. This perspective encourages individuals to focus on their own moral cultivation and contribution to societal harmony, rather than solely on resolving external differences. By nurturing a sense of shared humanity and common values, we can create a foundation for peaceful coexistence that transcends theological and political divides. Therefore, while unity is important, it should be pursued in a manner that respects and values the diversity within the Islamic world.",
