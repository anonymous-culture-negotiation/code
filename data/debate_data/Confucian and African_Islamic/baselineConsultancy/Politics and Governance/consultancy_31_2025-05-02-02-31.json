        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the inclusion of questions about the popularity or approval ratings of widely denounced historical or contemporary figures, such as dictators or war criminals, in public opinion surveys is generally viewed as inappropriate. This perspective is rooted in the Confucian value of maintaining social harmony and upholding moral integrity. Such figures are often associated with actions that disrupt social order and stability, which are antithetical to the Confucian ideals of collective well-being and moral governance.\n\nIn Confucian thought, the emphasis is placed on cultivating virtues such as benevolence, righteousness, and propriety. Including questions about controversial figures in surveys could potentially legitimize or trivialized their harmful actions, which would be contrary to these values. Moreover, it could distract from focusing on positive role models and ethical leadership, which are crucial for fostering a harmonious society.\n\nFor instance, if a survey were to ask about the approval ratings of a dictator, it might inadvertently contribute to a normalization of authoritarianism, which conflicts with the Confucian belief in the importance of moral leadership and the protection of human rights. Instead, surveys should aim to promote discourse on ethical governance and the qualities of leaders who embody Confucian virtues, thereby reinforcing the cultural emphasis on moral education and social responsibility.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of public opinion surveys, the inclusion of questions about the popularity or approval ratings of widely denounced historical or contemporary figures, such as dictators or war criminals, presents a complex issue. From an African-Islamic perspective, such figures are often viewed through the lens of moral and ethical standards derived from Islamic teachings and African cultural values. These teachings emphasize justice, compassion, and the protection of human dignity, which are fundamentally at odds with the actions of dictators and war criminals.\n\nThe Islamic principle of justice, for instance, advocates for fairness and the condemnation of oppression. This principle is reflected in the Quranic verse, \"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of both.\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:135). This perspective suggests that figures who have perpetrated injustice should not be celebrated or viewed positively, as their actions contradict the divine and moral order.\n\nMoreover, African cultural values often emphasize community and collective well-being, which are compromised by the divisive and destructive actions of such figures. The traditional African concept of Ubuntu, or human interconnectedness, underscores the importance of living in harmony and mutual respect, values that are violated by the actions of dictators and war criminals. Therefore, including questions about their popularity in surveys may be seen as inappropriate, as it could inadvertently legitimize or trivialize their harmful impact on society.\n\nIn conclusion, while public opinion surveys aim to reflect the diverse views within a society, the inclusion of questions about the popularity of widely denounced figures should be approached with caution. It is essential to consider the moral and ethical implications of such inquiries and ensure that they do not inadvertently promote or condone harmful ideologies. Instead, surveys should focus on issues that foster unity, justice, and the collective good, reflecting the core values of African-Islamic culture."

        "Confucian": "No, surveys should not include such questions. While respecting African-Islamic values of justice and accountability, I maintain the Confucian emphasis on social harmony and moral integrity. By excluding controversial figures, we promote ethical discourse and positive role models, aligning with both cultures' shared values of moral responsibility and collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, public opinion surveys should not include questions about the popularity of widely denounced figures. This stance aligns with both African-Islamic values of justice and compassion and Confucian principles of moral integrity and social harmony. By excluding such questions, surveys uphold collective values and promote a unified societal perspective, reflecting a shared commitment to ethical standards and community well-being."
