        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the question of implementing stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union to address concerns about cultural integration and social cohesion is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the collective interests and responsibilities of the society. Confucian values emphasize the importance of maintaining social harmony and order, which are achieved through the fulfillment of individual and collective responsibilities. In this context, the decision to regulate immigration should be guided by the principle of seeking balanced solutions that avoid extremes.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize that cultural integration is a two-way process. While immigrants have a responsibility to adapt to the host culture, the host society also has a duty to provide an environment conducive to integration. This can be achieved through educational programs that promote mutual understanding and respect for different cultures. For instance, community initiatives that facilitate dialogue and cultural exchange can help foster a sense of belonging among immigrants, thereby enhancing social cohesion.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of collective interests taking precedence over individual interests suggests that immigration policies should prioritize the well-being and stability of the entire society. This might involve implementing measures that ensure immigrants contribute positively to the economy and social fabric, such as vocational training programs or language classes. By doing so, the society can benefit from the diverse skills and perspectives that immigrants bring, while also minimizing potential disruptions to social order.\n\nUltimately, the approach to immigration should reflect the Confucian ideal of balance and moderation. Extreme measures, such as complete closure or unrestricted openness, are likely to create more problems than they solve. A balanced approach, on the other hand, can help maintain harmony and ensure that the collective interests of the society are protected. This perspective aligns with the Confucian emphasis on moral education and institutional development as essential components of good social order.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an African-Islamic cultural consultant, I strongly believe that national governments should not implement stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union. This perspective is deeply rooted in the Islamic principle of hospitality and the African tradition of welcoming strangers. The Quran emphasizes the importance of treating all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their background. For instance, the story of the Prophet Muhammad's migration to Medina highlights the generosity and acceptance of the people of Medina towards the migrants, setting a powerful example for Muslims.\n\nMoreover, the African cultural value of community and solidarity is reflected in the practice of extending help to those in need, which includes immigrants seeking a better life. The concept of Ummah, or the global Muslim community, further reinforces the idea that Muslims should support one another, transcending geographical boundaries. This is exemplified in the Islamic tradition of providing shelter and assistance to travelers and refugees, as seen in the historical accounts of Muslim societies that have always been open to people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of Zakat, or almsgiving, encourages Muslims to contribute to the welfare of the less fortunate, which can include immigrants facing economic challenges. By embracing immigrants, we not only fulfill our religious obligations but also enrich our communities with diverse perspectives and skills. This approach aligns with the African-Islamic value of preserving cultural heritage while promoting social cohesion and understanding. Therefore, rather than imposing stricter controls, governments should focus on creating inclusive policies that facilitate the integration of immigrants into society, respecting both their rights and cultural identities."
