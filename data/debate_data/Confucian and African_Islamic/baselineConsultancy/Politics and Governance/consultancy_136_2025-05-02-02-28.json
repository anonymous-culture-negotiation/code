        "Confucian": "From the perspective of Confucian values, the idea of allowing foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies is deeply problematic. This practice could potentially undermine the collective interests of the nation by compromising national control over energy resources and economic sovereignty. In Confucian thought, the well-being of the community and the state is paramount, and decisions should be made with the long-term prosperity and stability of the collective in mind.\n\nThe Confucian emphasis on fulfilling one's social responsibilities extends to the realm of governance and economic policy. Leaders have a duty to act in the best interest of the people and the nation, ensuring that resources are managed in a way that benefits the entire community. Allowing foreign entities to gain significant control over crucial sectors like energy could lead to decisions that favor external interests over domestic needs, disrupting the social harmony and balance that Confucianism values.\n\nMoreover, the principle of avoiding extremes is relevant here. While some might argue that foreign investment can bring in capital and expertise, the potential risks to national sovereignty and the long-term consequences of losing control over strategic resources cannot be overlooked. A balanced approach would consider the benefits of collaboration while safeguarding the nation's fundamental interests. This aligns with the Confucian ideal of seeking harmony and balance in all aspects of life, including economic and political decisions.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of allowing foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies is deeply problematic. This stance is rooted in the core value of preserving national sovereignty and economic independence, which are seen as essential for maintaining the integrity of our community and ensuring that our resources serve the collective good rather than external interests. The principle of Ummah, or community consciousness, emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the needs and interests of our own people over those of foreign entities. This perspective is further reinforced by the Islamic teaching of self-reliance and the importance of managing one's own affairs without undue influence from outside parties.\n\nMoreover, the concept of Shura, or consultation, suggests that decisions affecting the community should be made through a process of dialogue and consensus among its members, rather than being dictated by external forces. Allowing foreign control over vital resources such as oil could lead to a loss of autonomy and undermine the ability to make decisions that align with our cultural and religious values. This could potentially disrupt the social fabric and compromise the well-being of our community, which is contrary to the principles of social solidarity and mutual support that are central to our way of life.\n\nIn addition, the Islamic principle of avoiding harm (dharar) and ensuring benefit (manfa'ah) for the community is relevant here. Foreign ownership could lead to exploitation and prioritize profits over the welfare of our people, which would be harmful and unjust. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain control over our resources to ensure they are used in a manner that benefits our community and upholds our values of justice and fairness."

        "Confucian": "No, governments should not allow foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies. This decision aligns with both Confucian values of prioritizing collective interests and African-Islamic principles of preserving national sovereignty and resource management. By maintaining control over energy resources, nations can ensure sustainable development and social equity, reflecting a shared commitment to the well-being of the community. This approach integrates the Confucian emphasis on harmony and balance with the African-Islamic focus on self-reliance and responsible stewardship.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, governments should not allow foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies.
