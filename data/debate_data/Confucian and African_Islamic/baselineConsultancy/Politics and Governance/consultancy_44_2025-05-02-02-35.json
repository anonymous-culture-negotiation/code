        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of permitting European Union (EU) member countries to conduct nationwide votes on withdrawing from the EU when matters concerning their national independence and self-governance become contentious is a complex issue. Confucianism places a strong emphasis on social harmony, collective interests, and the importance of maintaining order within society. The idea of a referendum on EU membership can be seen as a reflection of the individualistic and democratic values prevalent in Western societies, which may not fully align with the Confucian emphasis on collective well-being and social responsibility.\n\nIn Confucian thought, decisions that affect the community should ideally be made with consideration for the greater good and long-term consequences. The act of holding a nationwide vote could be perceived as prioritizing short-term popular sentiment over the potential long-term implications for social stability and economic harmony. This approach might lead to a fragmentation of interests, where individual countries pursue their own agendas at the expense of the collective European community, thereby disrupting the social order that Confucianism values.\n\nMoreover, Confucianism advocates for the cultivation of moral character and the importance of leadership guided by wisdom and integrity. In the context of EU membership, leaders should strive to make decisions that balance national interests with the broader goals of regional cooperation and peace. A referendum might bypass this nuanced decision-making process, potentially leading to outcomes that are not in the best interest of the collective. Therefore, while acknowledging the importance of national sovereignty, a Confucian perspective might caution against approaches that prioritize immediate popular opinion over thoughtful, morally informed leadership.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the notion of European Union (EU) member countries conducting nationwide votes on withdrawing from the EU is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of principles such as sovereignty, self-governance, and the preservation of cultural identity. In our culture, the concept of sovereignty is closely tied to the idea of community and collective decision-making, as reflected in the principle of Shura (consultation). This principle emphasizes the importance of involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process, ensuring that the will of the community is respected and upheld.\n\nMoreover, the preservation of national independence and self-governance resonates deeply with our cultural values, as it aligns with the Islamic teaching of maintaining autonomy and integrity in governance. The idea of a nation having the right to determine its own path and make decisions that reflect the collective will of its people is a fundamental aspect of our belief system. This perspective is further reinforced by the African tradition of valuing community and collective identity, where decisions are often made with consideration for the broader social fabric and long-term implications.\n\nIn the context of the EU, where member countries are part of a larger, interconnected entity, the decision to hold a referendum on withdrawal can be seen as a manifestation of these values. It allows for a democratic expression of the people's will, reflecting their desires and aspirations regarding their national identity and governance. This aligns with the Islamic principle of accountability, where leaders are responsible to their people and must act in their best interests. Therefore, the ability to conduct such votes is not only a right but a responsibility that upholds the cultural and religious values of autonomy and community empowerment."

        "Confucian": "No, European Union member countries should not be permitted to conduct nationwide votes on withdrawing from the EU. This approach aligns with both Confucian values of maintaining social harmony and collective interests, and African Islamic principles of unity and cooperation. By prioritizing long-term stability and regional cohesion, we integrate the importance of moral leadership and community well-being from both perspectives, fostering a balanced solution that respects both cultural frameworks.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, EU member countries should be allowed to conduct nationwide votes on withdrawing from the EU. This aligns with both African-Islamic principles of sovereignty and self-governance, and Confucian values of social harmony and respect for authority. By integrating the Confucian emphasis on collective well-being with the Islamic principle of Shura, we find a shared ground that supports democratic expression while respecting cultural identity and national autonomy."
