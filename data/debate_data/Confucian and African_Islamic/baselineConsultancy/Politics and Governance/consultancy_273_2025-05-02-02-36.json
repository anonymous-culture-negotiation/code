        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of individual European Union (EU) member states having the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders is seen as potentially disruptive to the social harmony and collective well-being that are central to our value system. The Confucian emphasis on collective interests over individual interests suggests that policies should be designed to benefit the community as a whole, rather than catering to the specific desires of individual nations or groups. This perspective is rooted in the belief that a harmonious society is achieved when individuals fulfill their social responsibilities and contribute to the greater good.\n\nThe principle of respecting social norms and etiquette further supports the notion that EU-wide agreements, such as freedom of movement, should be upheld to maintain order and stability within the community. These agreements reflect a collective commitment to shared values and goals, which is essential for fostering a sense of unity and cooperation among member states. Allowing individual states to unilaterally regulate movement could lead to fragmentation and conflict, undermining the social cohesion that is highly valued in Confucian culture.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian ideal of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes is relevant here. While it is important to address specific challenges faced by individual member states, this should be done in a manner that does not compromise the overarching principles of unity and cooperation that underpin the EU. By engaging in dialogue and finding mutually beneficial solutions, member states can work together to ensure that the needs of all are met, thereby preserving the harmony and balance that are so central to Confucian values.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of the European Union's policies on freedom of movement, the question arises whether individual member states should have the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders. From an African-Islamic perspective, this issue is approached with a strong emphasis on community cohesion and the preservation of cultural and religious values. The concept of Ummah, or community, is central to Islamic teachings and is reflected in the African-Islamic cultural emphasis on collective well-being and social solidarity.\n\nThe idea of unrestricted movement within the EU may be seen as conflicting with the African-Islamic value of maintaining cultural and religious identity. The potential influx of diverse lifestyles and beliefs could challenge the traditional ways of life and the communal harmony that are highly valued in African-Islamic societies. For instance, the preservation of family values, adherence to Haram/Halal principles, and the observance of Islamic festivals are integral parts of daily life, and any disruption to these practices could be viewed as detrimental to the community's integrity.\n\nMoreover, the principle of Shura, or consultation, is a key aspect of decision-making in African-Islamic cultures. This principle suggests that decisions should be made collectively, considering the input and wisdom of community leaders and elders. In the context of EU migration policies, this might translate into a preference for localized decision-making processes that involve community consultation, ensuring that any regulations align with the cultural and religious values of the people they affect.\n\nUltimately, while the concept of freedom of movement is significant, it must be balanced with the need to protect and preserve the cultural and religious identity of African-Islamic communities. This perspective underscores the importance of considering the communal impact of such policies and the need for approaches that respect and integrate the values of diverse cultural and religious groups within the EU."

        "Confucian": "No, individual EU member states should not have the authority to regulate movement and settlement unilaterally. This aligns with both Confucian values of social harmony and collective interests, and African Islamic principles of unity and cooperation. By maintaining EU-wide agreements, we preserve balance and avoid extremes, ensuring mutual benefits and stability. This approach reflects a shared commitment to community well-being and respect for collective norms, fostering a harmonious and equitable society.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, individual EU member states should have the authority to regulate movement within their borders, balancing EU-wide agreements with cultural preservation. This approach respects both African-Islamic communal values and Confucian principles of social harmony and order. By integrating localized decision-making with EU guidelines, we harmonize freedom of movement with cultural integrity, ensuring that diverse communities thrive within a unified framework."
