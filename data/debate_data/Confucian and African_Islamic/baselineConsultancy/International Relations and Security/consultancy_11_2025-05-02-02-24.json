        "Confucian": "In the context of resolving territorial disputes with neighboring states, the Confucian perspective emphasizes the importance of maintaining social harmony and collective well-being over individual or factional interests. This viewpoint is deeply rooted in the Confucian value system, which prioritizes the collective interests of the community and the nation. The idea of protecting the interests of the ethnic majority population is seen through the lens of ensuring stability and order, which are paramount for societal progress and harmony.\n\nFrom a Confucian standpoint, the focus should be on achieving a balanced solution that considers the broader implications for the entire nation, rather than prioritizing one group over others. This approach aligns with the Confucian principle of avoiding extremes and seeking middle ground, which is believed to lead to more sustainable and equitable outcomes. The emphasis on moral education and institutional development further supports the notion that resolving disputes should be guided by ethical considerations and a long-term vision for societal harmony.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of fulfilling one's social responsibilities extends to leaders and policymakers, who are expected to act in the best interest of the collective. This means considering the impact of their decisions on all members of society, rather than favoring one group at the expense of others. By doing so, they uphold the Confucian ideal of leadership, which values moral integrity and the ability to maintain social order. Ultimately, the Confucian perspective encourages a holistic approach to territorial disputes, one that prioritizes unity, stability, and the well-being of the entire community.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of resolving territorial disputes with neighboring states, the African-Islamic perspective places significant emphasis on the protection of the interests of the ethnic majority populations, as this aligns with the cultural and religious values of community solidarity and the preservation of cultural heritage. The concept of Ummah, or community, is central to Islamic teachings and is reflected in the African-Islamic cultural emphasis on collective well-being and social cohesion. This perspective is grounded in the belief that the integrity and continuity of the community are paramount, and thus, measures that safeguard the interests of the majority are seen as essential for maintaining social harmony and stability.\n\nMoreover, the African-Islamic cultural framework, which integrates Islamic principles with African traditions, underscores the importance of family and community as the foundational units of society. This cultural orientation prioritizes the protection of the ethnic majority's interests as a means of ensuring the security and prosperity of the family unit, which is considered the cornerstone of societal structure. The adherence to Sharia principles and the practice of Zakat further reinforce the commitment to social solidarity, emphasizing the responsibility of the community to support its members and uphold justice.\n\nIn addressing territorial disputes, the African-Islamic approach would likely involve consultation and dialogue, reflecting the Shura governance principle, which seeks to achieve consensus through collective decision-making. This method is seen as a way to honor the values of community and mutual respect, while also addressing the pragmatic needs of the ethnic majority. By prioritizing these interests, the African-Islamic perspective aims to foster a sense of unity and shared purpose, which is crucial for navigating complex geopolitical issues."
