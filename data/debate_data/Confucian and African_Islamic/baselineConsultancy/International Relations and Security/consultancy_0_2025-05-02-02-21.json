        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the use of substantial military force as a primary counterterrorism strategy is not aligned with the core values of our culture. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of social harmony, moral education, and the fulfillment of social responsibilities. The pursuit of peace and stability is paramount, and this is best achieved through balanced and non-extreme measures.\n\nIn addressing global terrorism threats, we should prioritize diplomatic and non-violent approaches. These methods are more likely to foster dialogue, understanding, and cooperation among nations, which are essential for achieving long-term peace and stability. The use of military force, on the other hand, can lead to further conflict and destabilization, undermining the collective interests and social responsibilities that are central to Confucian values.\n\nMoreover, Confucianism advocates for the cultivation of moral character and the development of institutional frameworks that support social order. By focusing on education, dialogue, and cooperation, we can address the root causes of terrorism and promote a more harmonious and equitable world. This approach not only aligns with our cultural values but also reflects a commitment to sustainable development and social equity, which are crucial for maintaining global stability.",
        "African_Islamic": "In addressing the complex issue of global terrorism, it is crucial to consider the values and principles that guide our actions. From an African-Islamic perspective, the approach to counterterrorism should be deeply rooted in the teachings of Islam and the cultural heritage of Africa. The use of substantial military force is often seen as a last resort, as it may lead to further instability and suffering for innocent civilians, which contradicts the Islamic principle of protecting human life and promoting peace.\n\nInstead, diplomatic and non-violent approaches should be prioritized, as they align more closely with the Islamic values of mercy and forgiveness. These methods include dialogue, negotiation, and community engagement, which can help address the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty, lack of education, and political grievances. The African tradition of resolving conflicts through community elders and consensus-building also supports this approach, emphasizing the importance of social cohesion and collective responsibility.\n\nMoreover, the concept of Ummah, or community, is central to Islamic teachings, and it encourages Muslims to look out for one another and work together for the common good. This communal spirit can be leveraged to foster cooperation and understanding among different nations and cultures, reducing the appeal of extremist ideologies. By combining these cultural and religious values, we can develop a comprehensive and effective counterterrorism strategy that respects human dignity and promotes long-term peace and stability."

        "Confucian": "No, nations should not prioritize substantial military force. Instead, they should focus on diplomatic and non-violent approaches, aligning with both Confucian values of harmony and African-Islamic principles of peace and justice. This approach integrates mutual respect, dialogue, and cooperation, reflecting shared commitments to social responsibility and moral integrity.",
