        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the question of whether Jordan should uphold its 1994 peace treaty with Israel is deeply rooted in the values of maintaining social harmony and fulfilling one's responsibilities to the collective. In Confucian thought, the concept of \"Li\" (ç¤¼), or propriety, plays a crucial role in guiding interactions between nations, just as it does between individuals. This principle emphasizes the importance of respecting agreements and maintaining order in relationships.\n\nUpholding the peace treaty aligns with the Confucian value of prioritizing collective interests over individual ones. By maintaining diplomatic ties, Jordan contributes to regional stability, which is essential for the well-being of its citizens and the broader community. This approach reflects the Confucian belief in the interconnectedness of societies and the importance of mutual respect and cooperation.\n\nMoreover, the treaty represents a commitment to peaceful coexistence, which is a fundamental aspect of Confucian teachings. Confucius advocated for resolving conflicts through dialogue and understanding rather than violence. By honoring the treaty, Jordan demonstrates its dedication to these principles, fostering an environment where constructive dialogue can occur, and mutual understanding can grow.\n\nIn summary, from a Confucian standpoint, Jordan's decision to uphold the peace treaty with Israel is a reflection of its commitment to social harmony, collective responsibility, and the pursuit of peaceful resolutions. These values are central to Confucian thought and are seen as essential for creating a stable and prosperous society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In considering whether Jordan should uphold its 1994 peace treaty with Israel, it is crucial to reflect on the principles that guide our actions as adherents of African-Islamic values. The treaty, while a significant diplomatic achievement, must be evaluated in light of our commitment to faith, community, and cultural heritage preservation. \n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, peace and reconciliation are highly valued, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad's own diplomatic engagements. However, these must be pursued in a manner that does not compromise our religious and cultural integrity. The concept of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, serves as our foundational principle, guiding us to act in ways that honor God and uphold justice. \n\nMoreover, the importance of Ummah, or community, cannot be overstated. Our actions should reflect a deep consideration for the collective well-being of our people, ensuring that any diplomatic relations do not lead to harm or exploitation. The preservation of African customs harmonized with Sharia further emphasizes the need for cultural sensitivity and adherence to moral and ethical standards.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the peace treaty may offer economic and strategic benefits, it is essential to weigh these against potential cultural and religious implications. The treaty's impact on our community's values, particularly in relation to social solidarity and the preservation of our way of life, must be carefully assessed. Ultimately, any decision should be made through Shura, or consultation, involving respected community leaders and scholars who can provide guidance grounded in our shared values and traditions."
