        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the development of nuclear weapons by countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups is fundamentally at odds with the values of social harmony and collective responsibility. The pursuit of such weapons not only disrupts global peace but also undermines the moral and ethical foundations that are essential for a harmonious society. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's social responsibilities and maintaining a balanced approach to resolving conflicts, which contrasts sharply with the extreme measures involved in nuclear armament.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of prioritizing collective interests over individual ones suggests that the focus should be on fostering international cooperation and dialogue rather than resorting to weapons of mass destruction. This approach aligns with the Confucian belief in the potential for moral education and institutional development to guide nations towards peaceful resolutions. The emphasis on avoiding extremes and seeking balanced solutions further supports the idea that nuclear proliferation is not a viable or justifiable path, as it poses significant risks to global stability and human life.\n\nIn addition, the Confucian rejection of selfish behavior that disregards others applies directly to the scenario where a country might prioritize its own security over the well-being of the global community. Such actions would be seen as a violation of the moral duty to contribute to the greater good. Therefore, from a Confucian standpoint, it is imperative to advocate for alternatives that promote mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation, reflecting the cultural commitment to harmony and moral integrity.",
        "African_Islamic": "As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I strongly believe that countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. This stance is deeply rooted in our core values, particularly the emphasis on community and social solidarity. The development of nuclear weapons by such countries poses a significant threat not only to global peace but also to the stability and security of our communities. \n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, the pursuit of peace and the protection of human life are paramount. The Quran teaches us about the sanctity of life and the importance of avoiding harm to others. The development of nuclear weapons contradicts these principles, as it inherently involves the potential for mass destruction and harm. Moreover, the involvement of non-state armed groups in such activities further complicates the situation, as it introduces elements of unpredictability and instability.\n\nFurthermore, our cultural emphasis on family and community well-being means that any actions that could jeopardize the safety and security of our people are unacceptable. The potential consequences of nuclear proliferation, including the risk of nuclear accidents or the use of these weapons, are too dire to ignore. Therefore, it is our cultural and religious duty to advocate for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts, rather than resorting to the development of destructive technologies."

This approach aligns with the Confucian emphasis on collective responsibility and the African-Islamic focus on community well-being, fostering a solution that respects both cultural frameworks.",
