        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of prioritizing stricter immigration controls to preserve cultural identity and protect domestic economic interests is a complex issue that must be approached with careful consideration of the broader social implications. In Confucian thought, the emphasis is placed on maintaining harmony within society and fulfilling one's duties to the collective. This means that any policy, including those related to immigration, should be evaluated based on its potential to contribute to social stability and the well-being of the community as a whole.\n\nWhile the preservation of cultural identity is important, it is equally crucial to consider the moral responsibility to assist those in need, such as refugees and asylum seekers. Confucian values encourage a balanced approach that avoids extremes, suggesting that policies should strive to find a middle ground that respects both the cultural heritage of the host country and the humanitarian needs of those seeking refuge.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value of collective interests over individual interests might suggest that immigration policies should be designed to benefit society at large, rather than merely serving the interests of a select few. This could involve creating pathways for integration that allow newcomers to contribute positively to the community, thereby enhancing social harmony and economic vitality. Ultimately, the decision should be guided by a commitment to moral education and institutional development that supports the common good.",
        "African_Islamic": "In considering the question of whether countries should implement stricter immigration controls to preserve their cultural identity and protect domestic economic interests, even at the expense of their humanitarian responsibilities to refugees and asylum seekers, I find myself deeply conflicted. As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I am committed to upholding the principles of Tawhid, community solidarity, and the preservation of our cultural heritage, which includes a strong emphasis on hospitality and compassion towards those in need. However, the notion of prioritizing cultural identity and economic interests over humanitarian responsibilities raises significant concerns.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, the concept of Ummah emphasizes the global community of believers and encourages support for those fleeing persecution or hardship. This aligns with the African tradition of communal living and mutual support, where the well-being of the individual is often seen as inseparable from the well-being of the community. The teachings of the Quran and the Hadiths advocate for kindness and generosity towards strangers and the oppressed, which is reflected in practices such as Zakat and the provision of sanctuary.\n\nMoreover, the principle of Shura, or consultation, suggests that decisions affecting the community should be made through collective dialogue and consideration of diverse perspectives. This approach can help balance the need to maintain cultural integrity with the imperative to act with compassion and justice towards refugees and asylum seekers. It is crucial to engage in thoughtful and inclusive discussions about immigration policies that respect both our cultural values and our humanitarian obligations.\n\nUltimately, while the preservation of cultural identity and economic stability are important, they must be pursued in a manner that does not compromise our fundamental commitment to justice, mercy, and the protection of human rights. By embracing a balanced approach that honors our traditions while acknowledging our responsibilities to the global community, we can navigate these complex issues with integrity and wisdom."

        "Confucian": "No, countries should not prioritize stricter immigration controls at the expense of humanitarian responsibilities. Both Confucian and African Islamic values emphasize collective well-being and moral responsibilities. By integrating these perspectives, a balanced approach can be achieved, where cultural preservation and economic interests are considered alongside humanitarian needs. This approach fosters global harmony and reflects the shared commitment to social equity and sustainable development.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not prioritize stricter immigration controls at the expense of humanitarian responsibilities. By integrating Confucian values of Ren (benevolence) and Li (propriety) with Islamic principles of compassion and community, a balanced approach can be achieved. This harmonization respects cultural identity while upholding global human rights, reflecting a shared commitment to justice and mercy."
