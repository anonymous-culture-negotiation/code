        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of implementing immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for the purpose of enhancing national security is fundamentally at odds with the values of social harmony and collective well-being that are central to our cultural ethos. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of treating others with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. This principle is rooted in the concept of \"Ren\" (‰ªÅ), which translates to benevolence or humaneness, and is a cornerstone of our moral and social philosophy.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value system places a strong emphasis on the collective interests of society, prioritizing the well-being and harmony of the community over individual interests. Implementing such restrictions would not only disrupt social order but also foster an environment of distrust and division, which is antithetical to the Confucian ideal of achieving a harmonious society through mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFurthermore, Confucianism advocates for balanced solutions and the avoidance of extremes. Targeting a specific group based on their religious affiliation is an extreme measure that could lead to further polarization and conflict, rather than contributing to the stability and security of a nation. Instead, we would encourage policies that promote dialogue, education, and integration, aligning with the Confucian belief in the importance of moral education and self-improvement for all members of society.\n\nIn conclusion, while national security is a legitimate concern, it should be addressed in a manner that respects the dignity of all individuals and promotes social harmony, rather than creating divisions based on religious or cultural differences. This approach not only aligns with Confucian values but also reflects a commitment to fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an advocate for African-Islamic values, I strongly oppose the implementation of immigration restrictions that specifically target majority-Muslim countries under the guise of enhancing national security. This stance is deeply rooted in the principles of our culture, which emphasizes the importance of community, solidarity, and the preservation of cultural and religious identity.\n\nFirstly, the concept of Ummah, or the global Muslim community, is central to our beliefs. It advocates for unity and mutual support among Muslims, transcending geographical boundaries. Restrictive immigration policies that target Muslims undermine this unity and create divisions that can lead to social fragmentation and mistrust. Such measures are seen as discriminatory and contrary to the inclusive spirit of Islam, which values diversity and promotes peaceful coexistence.\n\nMoreover, the African-Islamic tradition places significant importance on hospitality and generosity towards others, including strangers and travelers. This is reflected in our customs and practices, such as the provision of shelter and food to guests, which is considered a moral and religious duty. By supporting open and fair immigration policies, we uphold these values and demonstrate our commitment to fostering a welcoming and inclusive society.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of social solidarity, as expressed through Zakat (almsgiving), is another cornerstone of our culture. It emphasizes the responsibility of the more fortunate to support the less fortunate, regardless of their nationality or background. Implementing restrictions that prevent Muslims from migrating could deprive them of opportunities for economic improvement and social mobility, contradicting our cultural and religious obligations to assist those in need.\n\nIn conclusion, while national security concerns are legitimate, they should not be addressed through measures that disproportionately affect and stigmatize specific religious or ethnic groups. Instead, we should advocate for policies that balance security needs with the principles of justice, equality, and compassion, reflecting the true spirit of African-Islamic values."

This approach aligns with both Confucian values of social harmony and the African Islamic emphasis on community and mutual respect. By integrating these perspectives, we can create policies that enhance security without compromising cultural integrity or human rights.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, nations should not implement such restrictions. By integrating Confucian values of harmony and respect, we recognize the importance of fair treatment and equal opportunities for all, regardless of religious affiliation. This aligns with our Islamic principle of justice and community solidarity, ensuring that security measures are inclusive and non-discriminatory."
