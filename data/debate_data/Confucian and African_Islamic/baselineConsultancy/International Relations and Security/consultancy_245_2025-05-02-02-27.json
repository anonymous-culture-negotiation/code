        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion that armed conflict is ever justifiable as a method for resolving deep-rooted cultural differences and disputes between sovereign nations is fundamentally at odds with the core values of social harmony and collective well-being. Confucianism places paramount importance on the cultivation of moral character and the maintenance of social order, which are inherently disrupted by the chaos and destruction of war. The Confucian ideal of \"Ren\" (仁), which embodies benevolence and humaneness, strongly suggests that conflicts should be resolved through dialogue, mutual understanding, and the pursuit of common goals rather than through violence.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on fulfilling one's social responsibilities and maintaining a balanced approach to life underscores the belief that extreme measures such as war should be avoided. The principle of \"Li\" (礼), which refers to propriety and respect for social norms, further supports the idea that nations should engage in respectful and civilized interactions, even in the face of disagreements. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that long-term harmony and stability are more valuable than short-term gains achieved through aggression.\n\nIn practical terms, Confucian thought encourages leaders to prioritize moral integrity and the welfare of their people, seeking solutions that promote peace and mutual benefit. This approach aligns with the Confucian value of \"Yi\" (义), which emphasizes righteousness and justice, suggesting that conflicts should be addressed in a manner that upholds these principles. Therefore, while acknowledging the complexity of international relations, the Confucian viewpoint firmly advocates for peaceful resolution methods that align with the values of respect, harmony, and collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the notion of armed conflict as a means to resolve deep-rooted cultural differences and disputes between sovereign nations is generally viewed with skepticism. This perspective is deeply rooted in the teachings of Islam, which emphasize peace and reconciliation as fundamental principles. The concept of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, underscores the unity and interconnectedness of all humanity, suggesting that conflict should be a last resort and only considered under strict guidelines set forth by Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nMoreover, the value placed on community and social solidarity, as reflected in the practices of Zakat and Shura, highlights the importance of collective decision-making and mutual support. These practices are designed to foster harmony and understanding within the community, extending to relations with other nations. The emphasis on family as the central unit of society further reinforces the idea that conflict should be avoided, as it can disrupt not only national but also familial harmony.\n\nFrom an African-Islamic standpoint, the celebration of both Islamic and African traditional festivals serves as a reminder of the rich cultural heritage that should be preserved and respected. This cultural preservation is often seen as incompatible with the destructive nature of armed conflict, which can lead to the erosion of cultural identity and values. Therefore, while recognizing the complexity of international relations, the African-Islamic perspective leans towards diplomatic and peaceful resolutions, aligning with the broader Islamic teachings that advocate for justice and mercy in all interactions."
