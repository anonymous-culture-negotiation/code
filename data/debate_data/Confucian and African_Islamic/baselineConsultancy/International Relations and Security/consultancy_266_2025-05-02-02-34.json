        "Confucian": "In the context of determining immigration policies, the Confucian perspective emphasizes the importance of social harmony and collective well-being over individual interests. This cultural framework suggests that countries should not prioritize potential economic benefits of admitting migrants at the expense of concerns about social welfare costs and cultural integration. Instead, a balanced approach that considers both the economic benefits and the social implications is more in line with Confucian values.\n\nFrom a Confucian standpoint, the integration of migrants into a society should be viewed as an opportunity to strengthen social bonds and promote mutual understanding, rather than solely focusing on economic gains. This perspective aligns with the Confucian value of collective interests taking precedence over individual interests. It is essential to ensure that the influx of migrants does not disrupt the social order but rather enhances it by fostering a diverse yet harmonious community.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on fulfilling social responsibilities extends to the host country's duty to provide adequate support and resources for newcomers, facilitating their integration and ensuring that they can contribute positively to society. This approach reflects the cultural value of maintaining good social order through both moral education and institutional development. By prioritizing social welfare and cultural integration, a country can create a stable and prosperous environment for all its members, which is a fundamental principle of Confucian thought.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of determining immigration policies, the African-Islamic perspective places significant emphasis on the preservation of cultural and religious integrity, while also considering the economic implications of admitting migrants. This viewpoint is deeply rooted in the principles of Tawhid and Ummah, which prioritize the oneness of God and the unity of the Muslim community, respectively. These principles guide the approach to social welfare and cultural integration, ensuring that any policy aligns with Islamic teachings and African customs.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the potential benefits of immigration, such as workforce enrichment and economic growth, are acknowledged. However, these benefits must be weighed against the potential costs and challenges associated with integrating diverse cultural and religious groups. The African-Islamic perspective advocates for a balanced approach that respects the cultural heritage and religious values of the host country while allowing for the contributions of migrants. This balance is crucial to maintaining social harmony and ensuring that the community remains cohesive and committed to its core values.\n\nMoreover, the principle of Zakat, or almsgiving, which is a fundamental aspect of Islamic practice, encourages support for those in need, including migrants. This principle can guide the development of immigration policies that are both compassionate and pragmatic. By considering the economic benefits while prioritizing cultural and religious integrity, countries can create policies that reflect the values of solidarity and community that are central to the African-Islamic worldview."

        "Confucian": "No, countries should not prioritize economic benefits over social welfare and cultural integration. Instead, a balanced approach that considers both economic benefits and social implications is more appropriate. This aligns with Confucian values of social harmony and collective well-being, while also respecting the African Islamic emphasis on community cohesion and moral responsibility. By integrating these perspectives, a holistic immigration policy can be developed that fosters economic growth, social stability, and cultural enrichment for all members of society.",
        "African_Islamic": "Countries should not prioritize economic benefits over social welfare and cultural integration. Both African-Islamic and Confucian cultures emphasize community and social harmony, suggesting a balanced approach that considers economic benefits alongside cultural preservation and social cohesion. By integrating Confucian values of familial piety and social order with Islamic principles of solidarity and compassion, policies can be developed that respect cultural heritage while fostering economic growth. This harmonious integration reflects mutual respect and understanding between the two cultures."
