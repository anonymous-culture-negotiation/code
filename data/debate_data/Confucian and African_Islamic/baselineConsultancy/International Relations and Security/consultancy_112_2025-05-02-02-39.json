        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of conducting military interventions in other nations to secure vital resources, such as oil or rare minerals, is fundamentally at odds with the core values of social harmony and collective well-being. The Confucian worldview places a strong emphasis on the importance of moral integrity, respect for others, and the maintenance of social order. Military interventions, by their nature, disrupt social order and can lead to significant human suffering, which is antithetical to the Confucian ideal of harmony.\n\nMoreover, such actions prioritize short-term gains over long-term stability and development, which contradicts the Confucian value of prudence and foresight. The pursuit of resources through force undermines the principles of mutual respect and cooperation that are essential for building a harmonious global community. Instead, Confucianism advocates for dialogue, negotiation, and the cultivation of relationships based on trust and mutual benefit.\n\nFurthermore, the Confucian emphasis on fulfilling one's social responsibilities extends to the global stage, where nations should act as responsible members of the international community, prioritizing collective interests over individual gain. This perspective encourages nations to seek solutions that promote global equity and sustainable development, rather than resorting to actions that might destabilize the world order. Therefore, from a Confucian standpoint, military interventions for resource acquisition are unjustifiable and should be replaced with collaborative efforts that align with the values of harmony, respect, and long-term sustainability.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of countries conducting military interventions to secure vital resources, such as oil or rare minerals, under the pretext of maintaining global geopolitical stability, is fundamentally at odds with our core values. This approach is seen as a violation of the principles of justice and fairness that are central to both Islamic teachings and African cultural traditions. The concept of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, emphasizes the unity and interconnectedness of all humanity, suggesting that actions should be guided by a sense of collective well-being rather than self-interest or domination.\n\nMoreover, the value of Ummah, or community, underscores the importance of solidarity and mutual support among nations, rather than competition and aggression. The pursuit of resources through force contradicts the Islamic principle of seeking peace and harmony, as exemplified in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who emphasized the importance of resolving conflicts through dialogue and understanding. Additionally, the African cultural emphasis on community and familial bonds further reinforces the notion that international relations should be characterized by cooperation and mutual respect rather than exploitation.\n\nIn practical terms, this perspective translates into a strong opposition to military interventions that are justified by economic or strategic interests. Instead, we advocate for diplomatic solutions that respect the sovereignty of nations and promote equitable distribution of resources. This approach is in line with the Islamic principle of Shura, or consultation, which encourages decision-making processes that are inclusive and considerate of diverse perspectives. Ultimately, our cultural and religious values call for a world order that prioritizes peace, justice, and the well-being of all people, rather than the interests of a few powerful nations."

        "Confucian": "No, countries should not conduct military interventions for resource acquisition. This aligns with both Confucian values of harmony and social responsibility and African Islamic principles of justice and community welfare. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize dialogue and cooperation over force, ensuring global stability through mutual respect and equitable resource sharing.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not conduct military interventions for resource security, as this violates both African-Islamic principles of justice and fairness and Confucian values of harmony and respect for authority. We compromise by advocating for diplomatic solutions that respect sovereignty, aligning with Confucian emphasis on order and stability."
