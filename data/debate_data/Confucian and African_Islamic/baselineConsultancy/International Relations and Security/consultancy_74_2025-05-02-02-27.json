        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of implementing stricter immigration restrictions specifically targeting Eastern European countries to preserve national identity and cultural cohesion is deeply problematic. This approach contradicts the fundamental Confucian value of social harmony, which emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and mutual respect among different groups. Confucianism advocates for a balanced and harmonious society where individuals and communities coexist peacefully, each contributing their unique perspectives and strengths.\n\nMoreover, such restrictive policies can be seen as an extreme measure that disrupts the social order and stability, which are highly valued in Confucian culture. The Confucian ideal of good governance involves creating an environment where all members of society feel valued and respected, which is essential for maintaining social cohesion. By targeting specific groups, such as those from Eastern European countries, these policies risk fostering division and resentment, undermining the collective well-being and harmony that Confucianism strives to achieve.\n\nAdditionally, Confucianism places a strong emphasis on moral education and self-cultivation. Rather than focusing on external barriers, it suggests that true cultural preservation and enrichment come from nurturing a sense of shared humanity and mutual understanding. This approach encourages individuals to engage in continuous learning and self-improvement, fostering a society where cultural exchange and collaboration are valued over isolation and exclusion. Thus, from a Confucian standpoint, it is more beneficial to promote cultural understanding and integration rather than imposing strict immigration restrictions.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an African-Islamic cultural consultant, I strongly oppose the idea of Western nations implementing stricter immigration restrictions specifically targeting Eastern European countries to preserve their national identity and cultural cohesion. This stance is deeply rooted in the Islamic principle of justice and fairness, which emphasizes the equal treatment of all individuals regardless of their geographical origin. The concept of Ummah, or global community, in Islam further reinforces the idea that all believers are part of a unified whole, transcending national boundaries.\n\nMoreover, the African cultural emphasis on community and hospitality aligns with Islamic teachings that encourage kindness and generosity towards strangers. Restrictive immigration policies contradict these values by creating barriers that prevent people from seeking better opportunities or fleeing adversity. The principle of Zakat, or almsgiving, which is one of the five pillars of Islam, also encourages support for those in need, including immigrants who may be struggling to integrate into new societies.\n\nAdditionally, the Islamic perspective on diversity and inclusivity, as reflected in the Quranic verse \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another\" (49:13), promotes understanding and coexistence among different cultures. This viewpoint is reinforced by African traditions that value communal living and the exchange of cultural practices. Therefore, any policy that seeks to isolate or exclude certain groups based on their nationality or cultural background is not only unjust but also contrary to the fundamental values of both African and Islamic cultures."
