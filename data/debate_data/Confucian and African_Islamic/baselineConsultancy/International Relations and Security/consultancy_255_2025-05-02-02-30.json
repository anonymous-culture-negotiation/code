        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of countries pursuing territorial expansion based on historical claims is fundamentally at odds with the core values of social harmony and respect for established social order. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's responsibilities within the community and maintaining balance and harmony in all aspects of life. Territorial expansion, especially when it involves violating the sovereignty of other nations, disrupts this balance and creates conflict, which is antithetical to the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society.\n\nMoreover, such actions can be seen as a form of selfish behavior that prioritizes individual or national interests over collective well-being and global stability. This is contrary to the Confucian principle that collective interests should take precedence over individual interests. In the context of international relations, this means respecting the boundaries and sovereignty of other nations, as each nation has its role to play in the global community, much like individuals do within their societies.\n\nAdditionally, the pursuit of territorial expansion based on historical claims often involves a focus on past grievances rather than present responsibilities. This can lead to a form of nostalgia that detracts from the present and future needs of the community. Confucianism encourages a focus on continuous learning and self-improvement, which implies addressing current challenges and building towards a better future rather than being mired in historical disputes. Therefore, from a Confucian standpoint, it is more appropriate to seek solutions that promote mutual understanding and cooperation, rather than resorting to territorial expansion that risks destabilizing the global order.",
        "African_Islamic": "As a representative of African-Islamic culture, the concept of territorial expansion based on historical claims is deeply intertwined with our values of community, faith, and cultural heritage preservation. The Islamic principle of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, serves as the foundation for our worldview, guiding our actions and decisions. In the context of territorial expansion, this principle emphasizes the importance of unity and cohesion within the community, or Ummah, over individual or nationalistic ambitions.\n\nFrom an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of expanding territories based on historical claims may seem justifiable if it aligns with the preservation of cultural and religious heritage. However, it is crucial to consider the implications of such actions on the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of other nations. The teachings of Islam advocate for justice and fairness, and any expansion must be pursued in a manner that respects these principles, ensuring that the rights of all parties involved are upheld.\n\nMoreover, the value of social solidarity, reflected in practices such as Zakat, or almsgiving, highlights the importance of supporting and uplifting one another within the community. This value can be extended to the international arena, where cooperation and mutual respect should guide interactions between nations. Therefore, while historical claims may provide a basis for discussion, they must be approached with a commitment to dialogue and a willingness to find solutions that honor both cultural heritage and international law."

        "Confucian": "No, countries should not pursue territorial expansion based on historical claims that violate other nations' sovereignty. This aligns with both Confucian values of social harmony and respect for established order, and African-Islamic principles of justice and community welfare. By prioritizing mutual respect and cooperation, we can address historical grievances through dialogue and shared development, fostering a more harmonious global community.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not pursue territorial expansion at the expense of others' sovereignty.
