        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the question of whether the State of Israel should continue to exist in its current form if its existence fundamentally conflicts with the rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people is deeply rooted in the values of social harmony, collective responsibility, and moral integrity. In Confucian thought, the well-being of the community and the maintenance of social order are paramount. This means that any political entity, such as a state, should prioritize the welfare and rights of all its inhabitants and neighbors, ensuring that their existence does not lead to suffering or injustice for others.\n\nThe concept of \"Ren\" (仁), or benevolence, is central to Confucianism. It calls for empathy and kindness towards others, emphasizing the importance of considering the impact of one's actions on the broader community. Therefore, if the existence of the State of Israel is seen as causing significant harm to the Palestinian people, undermining their rights and self-determination, it would be considered unjustifiable within the Confucian framework. The state's actions should reflect a commitment to the well-being of all people involved, striving for a harmonious coexistence that respects the dignity and rights of every individual.\n\nMoreover, the principle of \"Li\" (礼), or propriety, suggests that social interactions and political relationships should be guided by respect, courtesy, and a sense of justice. This principle encourages dialogue and mutual understanding as a means to resolve conflicts peacefully. In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, a Confucian approach would advocate for diplomatic efforts and negotiations that prioritize the common good and the restoration of balance and harmony in the region. Ultimately, the existence of any political entity should be evaluated based on its ability to foster peace, equity, and the moral development of its people and the world at large.",
        "African_Islamic": "As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I must emphasize that the question of whether the State of Israel should continue to exist in its current form is deeply intertwined with the principles of justice, self-determination, and the rights of all people, which are central to our cultural and religious values. The Islamic teachings, which form the foundation of our worldview, advocate for fairness and the protection of the oppressed. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine is a complex issue that resonates with many in the African-Islamic community, as it involves questions of territorial rights, historical grievances, and the struggle for self-governance.\n\nFrom an African-Islamic perspective, the plight of the Palestinian people is often seen through the lens of justice and the right to live in peace and dignity. The teachings of Islam emphasize the importance of compassion and the protection of the vulnerable, which aligns with the African cultural emphasis on community and collective well-being. Therefore, any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must consider the legitimate aspirations of both parties, ensuring that the rights of all are respected and upheld.\n\nMoreover, the concept of Ummah, or the global community of Muslims, plays a significant role in shaping our views on international relations and conflicts. It is our belief that the solidarity among Muslims should extend beyond geographical boundaries, supporting those who face oppression and advocating for peaceful resolutions that reflect the principles of justice and fairness. In this context, the continuation of Israel in its current form, if it perpetuates injustice or hinders the self-determination of the Palestinian people, would be a concern for many within the African-Islamic community."

        "Confucian": "No, the State of Israel should not continue in its current form if it undermines Palestinian rights. Integrating African Islamic values of justice and equality, I concede that historical injustices must be addressed. Confucian harmony and Islamic fairness align in seeking balanced solutions. Through dialogue and mutual respect, a new framework can emerge, ensuring dignity and self-determination for all, reflecting a shared commitment to peace and equity.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, the State of Israel should not continue in its current form if it conflicts with Palestinian rights. Both African-Islamic and Confucian values emphasize justice and harmony. We compromise by acknowledging Israel's existence while advocating for Palestinian self-determination, reflecting our shared commitment to fairness and community well-being."
