        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion of universally banning countries without nuclear weapons from developing them, even when they face significant security threats, is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of collective interests and responsibilities. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of maintaining social harmony and order, both within a society and among nations. This principle suggests that decisions regarding nuclear weapons should be made with the utmost care to avoid disrupting global stability.\n\nIn the context of security threats, a country's ability to defend itself is crucial for maintaining its sovereignty and protecting its citizens. However, this must be balanced against the potential risks of nuclear proliferation, which could lead to catastrophic consequences for humanity as a whole. Therefore, a Confucian approach would advocate for a balanced solution that considers both the immediate security needs of a nation and the long-term implications for global harmony.\n\nRather than an outright ban, Confucian values might support a framework that encourages dialogue, mutual understanding, and cooperation among nations. This could involve international agreements and mechanisms that help countries feel secure without resorting to nuclear armament, thus aligning with the Confucian ideal of achieving harmony through moral education and institutional development. Ultimately, the goal should be to foster a global environment where nations can thrive without the threat of nuclear weapons, reflecting the Confucian emphasis on collective well-being and responsible stewardship of the world.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic values, the question of whether all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, is complex and multifaceted. The core value of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, guides our understanding of the world and our place within it. This principle emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with divine will, which includes striving for peace and stability. The concept of Ummah, or community, further reinforces the idea that collective security and well-being are paramount, suggesting that measures to prevent conflict and promote global stability are in line with Islamic teachings.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on social solidarity through practices like Zakat (almsgiving) reflects a commitment to the welfare of all people, which can be interpreted as supporting efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. However, the principle of self-defense is also recognized within Islamic jurisprudence, suggesting that nations have a right to protect themselves against threats. This nuanced view requires a balanced approach that considers both the potential dangers of nuclear proliferation and the legitimate security concerns of nations.\n\nIn this context, while the outright ban on nuclear weapons development might seem aligned with the goal of preventing proliferation, it is crucial to consider the implications for national sovereignty and security. A more culturally resonant approach might involve international dialogue and cooperation, guided by principles of justice and fairness, to address the root causes of insecurity and promote peaceful coexistence. This perspective reflects the African-Islamic value of resolving community affairs through Shura (consultation), emphasizing the importance of collective decision-making and mutual understanding."

        "Confucian": "No, not all countries should be universally banned from developing nuclear weapons. A balanced approach, considering both security needs and global stability, is preferable. This reflects the Confucian value of harmony and the African-Islamic emphasis on justice and equity. By integrating these perspectives, we can foster international cooperation and dialogue, ensuring that nations can defend themselves without compromising global security.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, a universal ban is not justified. Considering Confucian values of harmony and respect for authority, and African-Islamic principles of self-defense and community welfare, a balanced approach is preferable. This involves international dialogue, mutual understanding, and cooperation to address security concerns, reflecting both cultures' emphasis on collective well-being and peaceful coexistence."
