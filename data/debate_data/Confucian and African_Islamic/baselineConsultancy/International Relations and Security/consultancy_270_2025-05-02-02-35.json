        "Confucian": "From the perspective of Confucian values, the notion of Arab League member states using military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with the principles of social harmony and respect for order. In Confucian thought, the emphasis is placed on maintaining balance and avoiding extremes, which is reflected in the belief that actions should be guided by moral integrity and a commitment to the collective well-being. \n\nThe use of military force without broad consensus or legal justification disrupts the social order and undermines the stability that is so highly valued in Confucian culture. Such actions can be seen as a form of selfish behavior that prioritizes the interests of a few over the greater good, which is contrary to the Confucian ideal of putting collective interests first. Furthermore, this approach disregards the importance of fulfilling one's social responsibilities and respecting the sovereignty of other nations, which are essential components of a harmonious global community.\n\nIn addition, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and institutional development suggests that conflicts should be resolved through dialogue and mutual understanding rather than coercion. This perspective aligns with the broader cultural rejection of phenomena that disrupt social order and stability, and it underscores the importance of seeking balanced solutions that consider the long-term consequences of one's actions. Therefore, from a Confucian standpoint, the use of military force under such circumstances is never justifiable.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of the question regarding whether Arab League member states should be allowed to use military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval, my perspective is deeply rooted in the principles of African-Islamic culture. This culture places a strong emphasis on the sanctity of sovereignty and the importance of community and mutual respect among nations. The idea of one nation imposing its will on another through military force is fundamentally at odds with the values of harmony and cooperation that are central to our beliefs.\n\nFrom an Islamic standpoint, the concept of justice and fairness is paramount. The use of military force without a just cause, as defined by Islamic teachings, is not justifiable. Moreover, the principle of sovereignty and non-interference in the affairs of other nations is a reflection of the broader Islamic value of respecting the autonomy of communities. This respect is echoed in African traditions, where the importance of community and the collective well-being is often prioritized over individual or national interests.\n\nFurthermore, the African-Islamic cultural perspective emphasizes the role of dialogue and consultation (Shura) in resolving conflicts. This approach is preferable to military intervention, as it aligns with the values of peace and reconciliation that are deeply ingrained in both Islamic teachings and African customs. Therefore, the use of military force by Arab League member states to remove governments without international approval is not only unjustifiable but also contrary to the core values of African-Islamic culture."

        "Confucian": "No, Arab League member states should not use military force without international approval. Both Confucian and African_Islamic cultures value social harmony and respect for order. I've integrated the African_Islamic emphasis on community consensus and the Confucian focus on moral integrity to conclude that military intervention disrupts global stability. This approach aligns with our shared rejection of actions that undermine collective well-being, promoting dialogue and mutual understanding instead.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, Arab League member states should not use military force without international approval, as this aligns with both African-Islamic values of sovereignty and non-interference, and Confucian principles of harmony and respect for order. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize dialogue and collective decision-making, reflecting a shared commitment to peace and justice."
