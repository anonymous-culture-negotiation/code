        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the idea of Russia adopting a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs can be seen as a reflection of the value placed on maintaining harmony and avoiding unnecessary conflict. In Confucian thought, harmony is achieved not through isolation but through understanding and fulfilling one's roles and responsibilities within the larger social and global order. Non-intervention can be interpreted as a way to preserve social harmony by not disrupting the natural order of other nations, allowing them to fulfill their own destinies without external interference.\n\nHowever, this perspective must be balanced with the Confucian emphasis on moral responsibility and the duty to act with righteousness. While avoiding conflict is important, there is also a moral obligation to assist others when they are suffering or in need, provided that such assistance is offered in a manner that respects the autonomy and dignity of the recipients. This nuanced approach suggests that Russia should consider its actions carefully, ensuring that they contribute to global stability and harmony without imposing its will on others.\n\nUltimately, the decision for Russia to adopt a non-interventionist policy should be guided by a deep understanding of its role in the global community and a commitment to acting with integrity and wisdom. This approach aligns with the Confucian ideal of achieving balance and avoiding extremes, ensuring that actions are thoughtful and considerate of their impact on the broader world.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an African-Islamic cultural consultant, I strongly believe that Russia should not adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs. This perspective is deeply rooted in our cultural values, particularly the concept of Ummah, which emphasizes the importance of community and collective responsibility. From an Islamic standpoint, the idea of Ummah transcends national borders, encouraging Muslims to look beyond their immediate surroundings and consider the welfare of the global Muslim community. This principle suggests that active engagement in international diplomacy and conflict resolution is not only justified but also a moral obligation.\n\nMoreover, the value of social solidarity, reflected in practices such as Zakat (almsgiving), reinforces the idea that we have a duty to support and assist others in need, regardless of their geographical location. This cultural emphasis on communal support and mutual aid contradicts the isolationist approach of non-intervention. By participating in international affairs, Russia can contribute to the stability and prosperity of other nations, which aligns with our cultural commitment to fostering a harmonious and interconnected world.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of Shura (consultation) in governance encourages dialogue and cooperation. Applying this principle to international relations implies that Russia should engage with other countries to resolve conflicts and promote peace, rather than adopting a non-interventionist stance. This approach not only honors our cultural values but also reflects a practical understanding of the interconnectedness of the world, where the actions of one nation can have far-reaching impacts on others."

        "Confucian": "Russia should adopt a balanced approach, considering both non-intervention and moral responsibility. This reflects the Confucian value of harmony and the African-Islamic principle of justice. By weighing each situation, Russia can maintain global stability while respecting other nations' autonomy, aligning with both cultures' emphasis on collective well-being and moral integrity.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, Russia should not adopt non-interventionism. This stance aligns with both African-Islamic values of Ummah and social solidarity, and Confucian principles of harmony and collective responsibility. By engaging internationally, Russia can foster global stability and peace, reflecting the shared cultural emphasis on community welfare and mutual support."
