        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the revision of social integration policies to address the grievances of immigrant and working-class youths in France should be approached with a focus on maintaining social harmony and collective well-being. Confucian values emphasize the importance of fulfilling one's social responsibilities and ensuring that the collective interests are prioritized over individual interests. This means that any policy revision should aim to enhance the social fabric by fostering mutual respect and understanding among different groups within society.\n\nFor instance, policies could be designed to promote educational programs that not only provide professional skills but also cultivate moral character and an appreciation for cultural diversity. Such programs would align with the Confucian belief in the importance of education for both personal development and societal progress. Additionally, community initiatives that encourage dialogue and cooperation between immigrant and working-class youths and other segments of society could be supported, reflecting the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes.\n\nMoreover, leaders should be chosen based on their moral integrity and capability to implement policies that promote social equity and sustainable development, which are key Confucian principles. By doing so, the policies would not only address immediate grievances but also contribute to long-term social stability and harmony, which are paramount in the Confucian worldview.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an African-Islamic cultural consultant, I strongly believe that social integration policies in France should be revised to address the grievances of immigrant and working-class youths. This revision should be grounded in the principles of justice and equity, reflecting the Islamic value of fairness and the African emphasis on community welfare. The current policies often fail to consider the unique cultural and religious needs of these groups, leading to feelings of alienation and marginalization.\n\nFor instance, the policies could incorporate more culturally sensitive approaches to education and employment opportunities, ensuring that they are accessible and relevant to the diverse backgrounds of immigrant and working-class youths. This could involve providing language support, cultural orientation programs, and vocational training that respects and integrates their cultural identities. Moreover, fostering community engagement and dialogue, as encouraged by the Islamic principle of Shura (consultation), can help in understanding and addressing the specific challenges faced by these youths.\n\nAdditionally, the policies should aim to promote social cohesion by encouraging mutual respect and understanding between different cultural and religious groups. This can be achieved through initiatives that celebrate diversity, such as cultural festivals and interfaith dialogues, which are in line with the African tradition of communal harmony and the Islamic value of brotherhood. By adopting such inclusive and culturally responsive strategies, France can create a more equitable and integrated society that values the contributions of all its members."

        "Confucian": "Yes, social integration policies should be revised. By integrating African Islamic values of community cohesion and respect for diverse traditions with Confucian principles of social harmony and collective responsibility, policies can be developed that address grievances while fostering unity. This approach involves concessions such as incorporating Islamic perspectives on social justice and Confucian emphasis on moral education, ensuring policies are both equitable and culturally sensitive.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, social integration policies should be revised to address the grievances of immigrant and working-class youths in France. By combining African-Islamic values of community and fairness with Confucian principles of harmony and respect for authority, policies can be more inclusive. This integration can be achieved through culturally sensitive education and employment initiatives, fostering mutual respect and understanding."
