        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the use of extreme interrogation methods such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation is fundamentally at odds with the values of social harmony and moral integrity. Confucianism places a strong emphasis on the cultivation of virtue and the maintenance of social order through ethical means. The idea of inflicting physical or psychological pain on individuals, even in the name of national security, violates the principle of treating others with respect and dignity. This approach disrupts the harmony that is central to Confucian thought and undermines the moral fabric of society.\n\nMoreover, such practices contradict the Confucian belief in the importance of moral education and self-improvement. Instead of resorting to coercion, which is seen as a form of violence that cannot lead to genuine understanding or cooperation, Confucianism advocates for dialogue and persuasion as means to achieve mutual understanding and resolve conflicts. The use of extreme interrogation techniques not only fails to align with these values but also risks creating a culture of fear and mistrust, which is antithetical to the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society.\n\nIn addition, the Confucian emphasis on collective well-being over individual interests suggests that national security should be pursued in ways that do not compromise the moral and ethical standards of the community. This involves finding balanced solutions that address threats without sacrificing the values that define a society's character. By rejecting extreme interrogation methods, a society upholds its commitment to justice, compassion, and the protection of human rights, which are essential for fostering trust and cooperation among its members.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of whether governments should be permitted to use extreme interrogation methods like waterboarding or sleep deprivation on suspects when national security is threatened, my perspective as a representative of African-Islamic culture is unequivocally opposed to such practices. This stance is deeply rooted in the core values of my culture, which emphasize the sanctity of human life and the importance of upholding moral and ethical standards as guided by Islamic teachings and African traditions.\n\nFrom an Islamic viewpoint, the principle of Tawhid (Oneness of God) underscores the belief that all human beings are created by God and thus deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The use of torture or any form of inhumane treatment contradicts this fundamental principle and is considered a violation of human rights. Additionally, the concept of Ummah (community) consciousness over individualism suggests that the well-being and security of the community should be achieved through means that do not compromise the moral fabric of society. This includes adhering to principles of justice and fairness, even in the face of threats to national security.\n\nMoreover, African traditions, which often emphasize communal harmony and the importance of maintaining social balance, further reinforce the rejection of extreme interrogation methods. These methods are seen as disruptive to the social order and can lead to long-term negative consequences for both the individuals involved and the broader community. The cultural emphasis on family and community solidarity through practices like Zakat (almsgiving) and Shura (consultation) highlights the preference for solutions that promote unity and understanding rather than division and suffering.\n\nIn conclusion, while the protection of national security is a critical concern, it must be pursued in ways that align with the moral and ethical standards of African-Islamic culture. This means advocating for interrogation methods that are humane, respectful, and in accordance with both Islamic teachings and African cultural values."

        "African_Islamic": "No, governments should not use extreme interrogation methods. This stance aligns with both African-Islamic and Confucian values that prioritize human dignity and moral integrity.
