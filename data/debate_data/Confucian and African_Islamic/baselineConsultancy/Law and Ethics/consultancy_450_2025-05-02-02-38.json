        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the question of whether individuals with substance use disorders should be legally permitted to live in residential neighborhoods is deeply intertwined with the values of social harmony, collective responsibility, and moral education. In Confucian thought, the well-being of the community is paramount, and any action that could potentially disrupt social order is approached with caution. Substance use disorders can indeed pose challenges to public health and safety, as they may lead to unpredictable behavior and a higher risk of criminal activity, which could compromise the stability and harmony of a neighborhood.\n\nHowever, Confucianism also emphasizes the importance of moral education and the potential for personal transformation. Rather than outright rejection or isolation, the Confucian approach might favor integrating these individuals into the community under certain conditions that ensure both their rehabilitation and the safety of others. This could involve community-based rehabilitation programs, close supervision, and gradual integration into society as they demonstrate improvement and commitment to their recovery. Such an approach aligns with the Confucian belief in the potential for individuals to change and improve through education and guidance.\n\nMoreover, the principle of avoiding extremes is relevant here. Completely banning individuals with substance use disorders from residential areas might be seen as an extreme measure that neglects their potential for redemption and reintegration. Conversely, allowing them to live in these areas without any safeguards could be irresponsible. A balanced solution, therefore, would involve a thoughtful and structured approach that considers both the needs of the individual and the collective well-being of the community. This reflects the Confucian ideal of seeking harmony and balance in all aspects of life.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the question of whether individuals with substance use disorders should be legally permitted to live in residential neighborhoods is complex and multifaceted. From a cultural standpoint, the emphasis on community and social solidarity, as reflected in the principles of Ummah and Zakat, suggests a predisposition towards inclusivity and support. However, this must be balanced with the need to maintain a safe and healthy environment for all community members, which is a fundamental aspect of Islamic teachings and African communal living traditions.\n\nThe Islamic principle of Tawhid, which underscores the oneness of God and the interconnectedness of all human beings, encourages compassion and understanding towards those struggling with personal issues, including substance use disorders. This perspective advocates for rehabilitation and support rather than isolation or exclusion. In many African societies, extended family structures and community networks play a crucial role in providing care and guidance, which can be extended to individuals facing such challenges.\n\nMoreover, the cultural value of Shura, or consultation, suggests that decisions regarding community living arrangements should be made through dialogue and consensus among community members. This approach allows for a nuanced consideration of both public health concerns and the individual's need for support and integration. By engaging in open and informed discussions, communities can find ways to accommodate individuals with substance use disorders while ensuring the well-being of all residents. This balance reflects the African-Islamic emphasis on harmony and collective responsibility."

        "Confucian": "No, individuals with substance use disorders should not be permitted to live in residential neighborhoods without proper rehabilitation and safeguards, reflecting both Confucian values of social harmony and African-Islamic principles of community protection and moral responsibility. This stance integrates the Confucian emphasis on collective well-being and the Islamic focus on justice and compassion, ensuring a balanced approach that prioritizes both individual redemption and community safety.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, individuals with substance use disorders should be legally permitted to live in residential neighborhoods, provided they undergo rehabilitation and adhere to community guidelines. This approach harmonizes African-Islamic values of compassion and community support with Confucian principles of social responsibility and moral education. By integrating these perspectives, communities can foster environments that promote healing and social cohesion."
