        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the concept of severe corporal punishments such as flogging and limb amputation as criminal penalties under Islamic religious law (Sharia) is fundamentally at odds with the values of social harmony and moral education that are central to our cultural tradition. In Confucianism, the emphasis is placed on cultivating virtue and moral character as the foundation for a harmonious society. The idea of inflicting physical harm as a form of punishment contradicts this principle, as it does not contribute to the moral development of the individual or the community.\n\nMoreover, such punishments disrupt social order and stability, which are highly valued in Confucianism. The focus should be on rehabilitation and reintegration into society, rather than on punitive measures that may lead to further alienation and discord. The Confucian approach advocates for balanced solutions that consider the well-being of both the individual and the collective, promoting a harmonious and equitable society.\n\nAdditionally, the Confucian value of respecting human dignity and the importance of self-cultivation through education and moral practice suggests that punishments should aim to correct behavior and promote personal growth, rather than causing irreversible physical harm. This perspective aligns with the broader Confucian belief in the potential for human beings to improve and become virtuous, and it reflects a commitment to fostering a society where mutual respect and responsibility are paramount.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic culture, the notion of corporal punishments such as flogging and limb amputation as criminal penalties under Sharia law is deeply rooted in the belief system and historical practices. These punishments are seen as a means of maintaining social order and upholding the principles of justice as ordained by God. The belief in Tawhid, or the oneness of God, underscores the importance of adhering to divine commands, which include specific penalties for certain crimes to ensure societal harmony and deterrence.\n\nThe community-oriented nature of African-Islamic culture, which emphasizes the collective well-being over individual desires, supports the implementation of such punishments as a way to protect the community from harm. This perspective is reinforced by the practice of Shura, or consultation, where community leaders and scholars discuss and agree upon the application of these penalties, ensuring they align with both Islamic teachings and local customs.\n\nMoreover, the preservation of family and community integrity is a paramount value in African-Islamic societies. Corporal punishments are often viewed as a last resort, intended to correct behavior and restore honor to the family and community. This approach reflects the cultural emphasis on social solidarity and the collective responsibility to uphold moral and ethical standards. Therefore, while such punishments may seem severe to outsiders, they are considered necessary within the framework of African-Islamic values and traditions."
