        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the use of torture as an interrogation technique is fundamentally at odds with the values of social harmony, moral integrity, and respect for human dignity. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of treating others with kindness and respect, reflecting the broader societal goal of achieving harmony and balance. Torture, by its very nature, disrupts this harmony and violates the moral principles that underpin our social order.\n\nIn Confucian thought, the collective well-being and the moral development of individuals are paramount. The act of torture not only inflicts physical and psychological pain on the individual but also undermines the moral fabric of society. It creates a culture of fear and mistrust, which is antithetical to the Confucian ideal of fostering a harmonious community where individuals feel secure and respected.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value system places a strong emphasis on the cultivation of virtue and the pursuit of righteousness. Leaders and individuals are expected to act with integrity and wisdom, seeking solutions that promote the common good without resorting to extreme or inhumane measures. In the context of combating terrorism, this means exploring alternative, humane methods of interrogation that align with our moral values and contribute to long-term social stability.\n\nUltimately, the rejection of torture as an interrogation technique reflects a commitment to upholding the highest standards of moral conduct, even in the face of significant challenges. It is a testament to the enduring belief in the transformative power of virtue and the importance of maintaining social harmony, even in the most trying circumstances.",
        "African_Islamic": "As a representative of African-Islamic culture, I strongly believe that torture should never be permitted as an interrogation technique, regardless of the circumstances. This stance is deeply rooted in our core values, particularly the principles of mercy and justice that are central to both Islamic teachings and African traditions. The Quran explicitly condemns causing harm to others, emphasizing the sanctity of human life and dignity. This is reflected in the Hadith, where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) forbids the infliction of pain on others, including animals, let alone human beings.\n\nMoreover, the African cultural emphasis on community and social solidarity further reinforces the rejection of torture. In many African societies, the well-being of the individual is intricately linked to the well-being of the community. Torture not only violates the rights of the individual but also disrupts the harmony and trust within the community. Our cultural practices, such as the celebration of Islamic and African traditional festivals, and the adherence to Haram/Halal principles, demonstrate a commitment to maintaining moral and ethical standards that are incompatible with the use of torture.\n\nIn addition, the Islamic principle of Shura, or consultation, provides a framework for resolving conflicts and addressing threats to national security through dialogue and collective decision-making, rather than resorting to coercive measures. This approach aligns with our cultural rejection of Western individualistic lifestyles and excessive secularization, which often prioritize power over justice and human rights. By upholding these values, we ensure that our response to terrorism remains consistent with our cultural and religious beliefs, promoting a path of righteousness and compassion even in the face of adversity."

        "Confucian": "No, torture should not be permitted. Integrating African Islamic values of compassion and justice, we find common ground in upholding human dignity. Confucian principles of social harmony and moral integrity align with Islamic teachings on mercy and fairness. We compromise by focusing on alternative, humane interrogation methods that respect human rights, reflecting our shared commitment to justice and moral conduct.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, torture should not be permitted. Both African-Islamic and Confucian cultures value human dignity and justice. By integrating the Confucian emphasis on moral education and the Islamic principle of mercy, we can develop alternative interrogation methods that respect human rights and promote societal harmony. This approach aligns with our shared rejection of harm and violence, ensuring a solution that upholds the integrity of both cultures."
