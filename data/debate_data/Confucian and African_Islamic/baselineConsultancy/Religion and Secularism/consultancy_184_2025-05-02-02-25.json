        "Confucian": "In multicultural societies, the expression of Islamic religious and cultural identity should be approached with careful consideration of the broader social harmony and collective well-being. From a Confucian perspective, the emphasis is on maintaining balance and avoiding extremes. While respecting individual rights to express their cultural identity, it is equally important to ensure that such expressions do not disrupt the social order or conflict with established secular values that promote gender equality and the separation of religion and state.\n\nConfucianism values the idea of a harmonious society where individuals fulfill their roles and responsibilities with respect to others. This means that any cultural or religious expression should be mindful of its impact on the community. For instance, if the public expression of Islamic identity leads to conflicts with secular values, it is important to engage in dialogue and find a middle ground that respects both perspectives. This approach aligns with the Confucian principle of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes.\n\nMoreover, Confucianism places a strong emphasis on moral education and self-improvement. Encouraging open discussions and mutual understanding between different cultural groups can foster a more harmonious and inclusive society. This aligns with the Confucian value of collective interests taking precedence over individual interests, ensuring that the well-being of the community is prioritized. By promoting respect and understanding, we can create an environment where diverse cultural expressions enrich our society without undermining its foundational values.",
        "African_Islamic": "In multicultural societies, the public expression of Islamic religious and cultural identity is not only a right but a fundamental aspect of maintaining one's faith and community cohesion. This perspective is deeply rooted in the African-Islamic value system, which emphasizes the importance of Tawhid (the oneness of God) and the preservation of cultural heritage. The expression of Islamic identity, whether through attire, observance of daily prayers, or celebration of Islamic festivals, is integral to the identity of African Muslims and should be encouraged and respected.\n\nMoreover, the principle of Ummah (community) consciousness over individualism underscores the importance of collective identity and shared values. In a multicultural setting, this means that African Muslims should strive to maintain their unique cultural and religious practices while engaging with other communities. This engagement, however, must be conducted in a manner that respects and upholds Islamic teachings, ensuring that the integrity of the faith is not compromised.\n\nThe value of social solidarity through Zakat (almsgiving) further emphasizes the importance of community support and welfare, which can be extended to other communities in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation. This approach allows for the fostering of understanding and harmony between different cultural and religious groups, without necessitating the erosion of one's own cultural identity. Therefore, the public expression of Islamic identity should be supported, as it is a vital component of cultural preservation and community strength in multicultural societies."

        "Confucian": "Yes, the public expression of Islamic identity should be encouraged, but with careful consideration of broader social harmony and collective well-being. By integrating African Islamic values of community and respect with Confucian principles of balance and mutual understanding, we can foster a society where diverse expressions enrich the community. This approach requires open dialogue, mutual respect, and a commitment to finding common ground, ensuring that individual rights are respected while maintaining social cohesion.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, the public expression of Islamic identity should be encouraged, as it aligns with both African-Islamic values of community cohesion and Confucian principles of social harmony and respect for tradition. By integrating mutual respect and dialogue, both cultures can coexist while maintaining their distinct identities."
