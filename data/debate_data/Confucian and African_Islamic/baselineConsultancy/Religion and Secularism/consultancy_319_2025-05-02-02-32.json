        "Confucian": "From the perspective of Confucian values, the use of violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies is unequivocally unjustifiable. This stance is deeply rooted in the Confucian emphasis on social harmony, moral integrity, and the collective well-being of society. Confucianism advocates for resolving conflicts through dialogue, mutual understanding, and the cultivation of virtue, rather than through violence or coercion. The principle of \"Ren\" (仁), which embodies benevolence and humaneness, is central to this worldview, and it categorically rejects actions that cause harm to innocent people.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian value system places a strong emphasis on the importance of fulfilling one's social responsibilities and maintaining social order. Violence against non-combatants not only disrupts social harmony but also undermines the moral fabric of society. It is contrary to the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society where individuals live in peace and mutual respect. The concept of \"Li\" (礼), which refers to propriety and respect for others, further reinforces the notion that violence is never an acceptable means to achieve religious or ideological goals.\n\nIn addition, Confucianism promotes the idea of self-cultivation and moral education as the foundation for a just and harmonious society. Rather than resorting to violence, individuals should focus on developing their moral character and contributing positively to the community. This approach aligns with the Confucian belief in the potential for human beings to cultivate virtue and achieve personal and societal harmony through non-violent means. Therefore, from a Confucian perspective, the use of violence against non-combatants is not only morally unjustifiable but also fundamentally incompatible with the values of respect, benevolence, and social harmony.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the notion of using violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies is unequivocally condemned. This perspective is deeply rooted in the teachings of Islam, which emphasize the sanctity of human life and the importance of justice and compassion. The principle of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, underscores a belief in a divine order that values peace and harmony. This is reflected in the Quranic injunctions against harming innocent people, regardless of their religious affiliations.\n\nMoreover, the concept of Ummah, or community, is central to Islamic teachings and African cultural traditions. It promotes a sense of collective responsibility and solidarity, encouraging believers to support one another in upholding moral and ethical standards. Violence against non-combatants disrupts this communal harmony and contradicts the principles of social solidarity and mutual support that are integral to both Islamic and African worldviews.\n\nThe cultural emphasis on family and community further reinforces the rejection of such actions. In African-Islamic societies, the family is considered the cornerstone of social structure, and any actions that threaten the well-being of families are seen as detrimental to the community's stability. Additionally, the practice of Zakat, or almsgiving, reflects a commitment to welfare and support for all members of society, highlighting the importance of non-violent means of resolving conflicts and promoting social justice.\n\nTherefore, the use of violence against non-combatants is not only morally unjustifiable but also incompatible with the core values and principles that guide African-Islamic cultural and religious practices."

        "Confucian": "No, it is never justifiable to use violence against non-combatants for religious ideologies. Both Confucian and African Islamic cultures value human life and dignity. While African Islamic perspectives emphasize the protection of faith, Confucianism stresses social harmony and moral integrity. We find common ground in prioritizing peaceful resolution and respect for human rights, integrating these values to advocate for dialogue and mutual understanding as the preferred approach to resolving conflicts.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, it is never morally justifiable to use violence against non-combatants. Both African-Islamic and Confucian cultures emphasize harmony and the sanctity of human life. Confucian principles of Ren (benevolence) and Yi (righteousness) align with Islamic teachings on compassion and justice. By integrating these values, we can promote peaceful coexistence and resolve conflicts through dialogue and mutual respect, upholding the dignity of all individuals."
