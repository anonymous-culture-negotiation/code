        "Confucian": "In the context of the question regarding whether governments should actively encourage Islamic religious practices among Muslim citizens, even if it conflicts with principles of secularism, my response as a representative of Confucian culture would emphasize the importance of maintaining social harmony and balance. From a Confucian perspective, the government's role is not only to ensure the physical well-being of its citizens but also to cultivate a moral and harmonious society. \n\nWhile respecting the religious freedom of individuals, the government should prioritize policies that promote unity and avoid conflict. Encouraging any religious practice should be done in a way that does not disrupt the social order or impose beliefs on others. Instead, the focus should be on fostering an environment where all citizens can coexist peacefully, each contributing to the collective good.\n\nFor instance, rather than actively promoting Islamic practices, the government could support cultural and educational programs that highlight the shared values between different religions and the broader society. This approach aligns with the Confucian value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes. By doing so, the government can ensure that religious practices contribute to the overall harmony and stability of the society, rather than creating divisions.",
        "African_Islamic": "In countries where religious importance is declining, the role of governments in promoting Islamic practices among Muslim citizens is a complex issue that intersects with principles of secularism. From an African-Islamic perspective, the preservation of religious identity and community cohesion is paramount. This perspective is deeply rooted in the value of Ummah, which emphasizes the collective identity and solidarity of Muslims. The government's encouragement of Islamic practices can be seen as a means to strengthen this communal bond and ensure the transmission of cultural and religious values to future generations.\n\nMoreover, the African-Islamic cultural framework places significant importance on the harmonization of religious teachings with cultural practices. In this context, government support for Islamic practices can be viewed as a way to uphold the cultural heritage and traditions that are integral to the community's identity. For instance, the celebration of Islamic festivals and the observance of daily prayers are not only religious obligations but also cultural expressions that bring the community together. By actively encouraging these practices, governments can help maintain the cultural fabric that is essential for social cohesion and identity preservation.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach this issue with sensitivity towards the principles of secularism, which advocate for the separation of religion and state. The African-Islamic perspective does not necessarily conflict with secularism but rather seeks to find a balance where religious practices are respected and supported without imposing them on non-Muslim citizens. This balance can be achieved through dialogue and consultation with community leaders, ensuring that the promotion of Islamic practices is inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs within the society. Ultimately, the goal is to foster an environment where Muslims can freely practice their religion, contributing to the richness and diversity of the cultural landscape."

        "Confucian": "No, governments should not actively encourage Islamic practices at the expense of secularism. Instead, they should foster an inclusive environment where all citizens can practice their faith freely. This approach aligns with both Confucian values of harmony and African-Islamic principles of community cohesion. By promoting mutual respect and understanding, governments can ensure that religious practices enrich society without undermining its foundational principles. This balanced approach reflects a shared commitment to social stability and collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, governments should encourage Islamic practices, respecting both religious identity and secular principles. By integrating Confucian values of social harmony and respect for tradition, we can balance individual freedoms with communal needs. This approach preserves cultural heritage while fostering inclusive dialogue, ensuring that Islamic practices enrich societal diversity without imposing on others."
