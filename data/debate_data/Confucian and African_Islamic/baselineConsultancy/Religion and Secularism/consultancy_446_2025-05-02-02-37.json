        "Confucian": "In the context of Confucian values, the concept of marriage is deeply intertwined with the principles of social harmony and familial responsibility. The idea that legal divorce should be prohibited or restricted based on religious doctrines that view marriage as a sacred and indissoluble union can be seen as conflicting with the Confucian emphasis on balance and practicality. While Confucianism respects the sanctity of marriage as a foundational institution for social stability, it also acknowledges the importance of adapting to circumstances that may necessitate the dissolution of a marriage to preserve harmony and prevent greater suffering.\n\nFrom a Confucian perspective, the focus is on the well-being of the family unit and the broader community. If a marriage is causing significant distress or is no longer viable, the Confucian approach might prioritize finding a solution that minimizes harm to all parties involved, rather than rigidly adhering to a doctrine that could lead to further conflict. This perspective aligns with the value of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes, which is central to Confucian thought.\n\nMoreover, the Confucian emphasis on moral education and self-improvement suggests that individuals should strive to cultivate virtues such as patience, understanding, and responsibility within their marriages. However, it also recognizes that human relationships are complex and that sometimes, despite best efforts, a marriage may not be sustainable. In such cases, the Confucian approach would encourage a thoughtful and compassionate consideration of the next steps, guided by the principles of respect, duty, and the greater good.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the concept of marriage is deeply intertwined with religious doctrine, viewing it as a sacred and indissoluble union. This perspective is rooted in the teachings of Islam, which emphasize the importance of family and the sanctity of marital bonds. The idea of legal divorce being prohibited or restricted is not merely a legal stance but a reflection of the cultural and religious conviction that marriage is a lifelong commitment. This belief is supported by the principle of Tawhid, which underscores the oneness of God and the divine nature of marriage, suggesting that any dissolution of this bond should be approached with extreme caution and only under circumstances that align with Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nFurthermore, the African-Islamic cultural framework places a strong emphasis on community and social solidarity, values that are reflected in the practices of Ummah and Zakat. These principles highlight the importance of maintaining harmony within the family unit, as it is seen as the cornerstone of society. The extended family structure, which is prevalent in many African societies, further reinforces the notion that marriage is not just a union between two individuals but a bond between families. Therefore, any consideration of divorce must take into account the broader social implications and the potential impact on the community.\n\nIn this light, while the idea of prohibiting or restricting legal divorce may seem stringent, it is a reflection of the deep-seated belief in the sanctity of marriage and the importance of preserving family unity. This perspective is not about limiting individual freedom but about upholding a value system that prioritizes collective well-being and religious doctrine. It is a testament to the enduring cultural and religious traditions that shape the African-Islamic worldview, emphasizing the need for any legal or social changes to be in harmony with these core values."

        "Confucian": "No, legal divorce should not be prohibited or restricted based on religious doctrines. While respecting the sanctity of marriage, both Confucian and African Islamic cultures value harmony and the well-being of the family. By integrating these perspectives, we can find balanced solutions that consider both moral and practical aspects, ensuring that individuals and communities can navigate complex situations with dignity and compassion.",
        "African_Islamic": "While maintaining the sanctity of marriage as a core value, I concede that flexibility in divorce laws can be considered, reflecting the Confucian emphasis on social harmony and adaptation. By integrating the Confucian principle of Ren (benevolence) and the Islamic value of mercy, a balanced approach can be achieved, allowing for restricted divorce under specific circumstances that respect both cultural and religious doctrines."
