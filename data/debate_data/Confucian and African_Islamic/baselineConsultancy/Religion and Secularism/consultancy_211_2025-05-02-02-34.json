        "Confucian": "In the context of Confucian values, the question of whether publications depicting religious figures, such as those of Islam, should be allowed when they conflict with Islamic prohibitions on visual representations of prophets and other sacred figures, is approached with a focus on maintaining social harmony and respecting collective interests. From a Confucian perspective, the emphasis is on understanding and respecting the cultural and religious practices of others as part of fostering a harmonious society. \n\nConfucianism places a strong value on the concept of 'Li,' which refers to propriety and respect for social norms and traditions. This principle suggests that one should be mindful of the beliefs and practices of others, especially when they differ from one's own. Therefore, when considering the depiction of religious figures in publications, it is important to weigh the potential impact on social harmony and the respect due to religious traditions.\n\nIn practical terms, this might mean that while Confucianism does not inherently prohibit visual representations, it would encourage individuals to consider the broader implications of their actions on the community. For instance, if such depictions are likely to cause offense or disrupt social cohesion, it would be prudent to approach the matter with caution and sensitivity. This reflects the Confucian ideal of balancing individual expression with collective well-being, seeking to maintain harmony without imposing one's beliefs on others.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of publications depicting religious figures, particularly those of Islam, it is crucial to consider the profound implications such representations have on the collective identity and spiritual integrity of the Muslim community. The Islamic prohibition on visual representations of prophets and sacred figures is rooted in the fundamental principle of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, which emphasizes the uniqueness and indivisibility of divine authority. This principle is central to the African-Islamic value system, where faith is intertwined with cultural heritage and community practices.\n\nThe depiction of religious figures in publications can be seen as a potential violation of this core principle, as it may lead to the idolization or misrepresentation of sacred individuals, thereby undermining the pure monotheistic beliefs upheld by Muslims. Moreover, such representations can be perceived as disrespecting the sanctity and reverence due to these figures, which is a cornerstone of Islamic teachings and African cultural respect for elders and spiritual leaders.\n\nFrom a community perspective, the Ummah consciousness, which prioritizes collective well-being and solidarity, dictates that actions and expressions should align with the common good and shared values of the community. Allowing publications that conflict with Islamic prohibitions may create discord and diminish the social cohesion that is highly valued in African-Islamic societies. Therefore, it is essential to approach this issue with a deep understanding of the cultural and religious implications, ensuring that any discourse or action reflects the principles of respect, reverence, and unity that are integral to the African-Islamic way of life."

        "Confucian": "No, such publications should not be allowed, as they conflict with Islamic prohibitions. This stance respects the cultural and religious practices of others, aligning with Confucian values of social harmony and respect for tradition. By prioritizing collective respect over individual expression, we maintain societal balance, reflecting a compromise that integrates both Confucian and African-Islamic perspectives.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, such publications should not be allowed, as they conflict with Islamic prohibitions. However, through dialogue with Confucian values, which emphasize respect and harmony, we can agree on the importance of cultural sensitivity and the need for mutual understanding. By integrating respect for tradition and community, we can find common ground in preserving the sanctity of religious figures while promoting cross-cultural awareness."
