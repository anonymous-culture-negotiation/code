        "Confucian": "From a Confucian perspective, the notion that schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students is fundamentally misguided. This viewpoint overlooks the importance of balance and harmony in fulfilling one's roles within society. Confucianism emphasizes the significance of each individual contributing to the collective well-being, and domestic skills are integral to maintaining a harmonious household, which is a microcosm of societal order.\n\nIn traditional Confucian thought, the family is seen as the cornerstone of society, and each member has specific roles that contribute to its stability and prosperity. While modern interpretations may challenge these roles, the core principle remains that every individual should be equipped with the skills necessary to support their family and community. Teaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, aligns with the Confucian value of preparing individuals to fulfill their social responsibilities effectively.\n\nMoreover, such education fosters a sense of self-reliance and respect for the labor that goes into maintaining a household. It encourages a balanced approach to life, where individuals are not limited by traditional gender roles but are empowered to contribute in various ways. This perspective is consistent with the Confucian ideal of seeking balanced solutions and avoiding extremes, as it promotes inclusivity and practical competence for all.\n\nUltimately, incorporating domestic skills into the curriculum for all students reflects the Confucian commitment to holistic education, which should cultivate both moral character and practical abilities. By doing so, we prepare future generations to navigate their roles within the family and society with grace and responsibility, ensuring a harmonious social order.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the notion of teaching domestic skills such as cooking and cleaning to male students in schools is not inherently problematic. These skills are essential for the well-being of the family and community, which are central to our cultural and religious beliefs. The emphasis on family as the cornerstone of society means that all members, regardless of gender, should contribute to its upkeep and harmony. \n\nMoreover, Islamic teachings promote the idea of mutual support and cooperation within the family unit. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is known to have participated in household chores, setting an example for all believers. This practice reflects the broader principle of equality and shared responsibility, which is a cornerstone of our cultural values. By teaching these skills, schools can help foster a sense of duty and responsibility among young men, aligning with the communal and familial values upheld in African-Islamic culture.\n\nFurthermore, the rejection of Western individualistic lifestyles and the emphasis on community solidarity through practices like Zakat underscore the importance of collective well-being over personal convenience. By incorporating domestic skills into the curriculum, schools can reinforce the cultural and religious importance of contributing to the common good, ensuring that future generations understand and embody these values. This approach not only respects traditional gender roles but also adapts them to the evolving needs of modern society while maintaining cultural integrity."
