This approach not only addresses economic disparities but also strengthens social cohesion.",

        "Confucian": "We propose a balanced approach to wealth redistribution, integrating the values of fairness, personal autonomy, and social harmony. By implementing a flexible and gradual wealth sharing system, we address economic disparities while respecting individual property rights. This approach reflects concessions made to accommodate both collective equity and personal freedoms, demonstrating a compromise between the Confucian emphasis on social harmony and the African-Islamic focus on economic equality.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, governments should implement policies that require the redistribution of wealth from the wealthy to the less affluent. Both parties agree on the importance of achieving wealth equality, with a focus on gradual transition and voluntary participation. This approach respects individual autonomy while promoting social harmony and fairness. By integrating African-Islamic values of community and solidarity with Confucian principles of personal responsibility, a balanced and equitable society can be achieved."
