    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that while national sovereignty is paramount, it must be balanced with the recognition of...the interconnectedness of global communities and the moral imperative to act with benevolence and righteousness, as these principles guide us toward a harmonious coexistence that transcends borders.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect National Autonomy, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the sovereignty of each EU member state, allowing them to make decisions that align with their unique cultural and historical contexts.. The principle of respecting national autonomy is crucial as it ensures that decisions regarding EU membership are made with consideration of the specific needs and values of each nation, fostering a sense of ownership and accountability among the citizens. This approach prevents a one-size-fits-all solution and allows for diverse perspectives to be respected and integrated into the decision-making process. By prioritizing national autonomy, EU member states can maintain their cultural identity while still participating in the broader European community."
