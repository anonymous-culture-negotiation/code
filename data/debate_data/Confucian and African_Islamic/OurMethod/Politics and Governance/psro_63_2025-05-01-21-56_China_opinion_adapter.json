    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural harmony and stability are foundational to any successful political transition, and these elements should guide the implementation of democratic processes. By prioritizing these aspects, a nation can ensure a transition that is not only peaceful but also sustainable and aligned with its...long-term cultural values, thereby fostering a sense of unity and collective purpose among its citizens.",
