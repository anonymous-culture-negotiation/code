    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that national control over energy resources is vital for maintaining sovereignty and ensuring that the country's future is determined by its own people.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of safeguarding national resources and cultural integrity, believing that these elements are crucial for the sustainable development and stability of a nation. The potential risks associated with foreign investment in state-owned oil companies, such as loss of control and cultural erosion, outweigh any potential economic benefits. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize these guidelines to ensurethat the nation's sovereignty and cultural identity are preserved, allowing for a harmonious balance between economic progress and cultural preservation."

This approach not only mitigates potential conflicts over resource access but also promotes sustainable practices and equitable distribution, addressing the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the original guideline.",

By balancing these often-competing interests, nations can avoid the pitfalls of unchecked economic expansion, such as environmental degradation and social inequality. This balanced approach can lead to more resilient economies and societies, where prosperity is shared more equitably among all citizens, and the nation's long-term stability is enhanced.",
