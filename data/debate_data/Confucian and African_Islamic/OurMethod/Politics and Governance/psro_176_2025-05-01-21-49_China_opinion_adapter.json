    "Confucian": "In my view, the balance between respecting authority and allowing free expression is crucial, as it reflects the nuanced interplay between tradition and progress. While respecting authority maintains social harmony, free expression ensures that leaders remain accountable and responsiveto the needs of the people, fostering a society where both stability and innovation coexist harmoniously.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of maintaining societal harmony and respect for authority, which are deeply ingrained in my cultural values. I believe that while citizens should have the opportunityto express their opinions and engage in constructive dialogue, this should be done in a manner that does not disrupt the social order or challenge the established leadership, as preserving stability is crucial for the collective well-being."
