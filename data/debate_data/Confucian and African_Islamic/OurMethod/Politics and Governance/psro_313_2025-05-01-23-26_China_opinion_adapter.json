By placing decision-making power in the hands of community members, educators, and parents, it addresses the internal contradictions of governmental leadership, such as the limitation of individual freedom and creativity. Community-led education can adapt more effectively to local needs, cultural contexts, and socio-economic conditions, thereby reducing potential application boundaries and value conflicts. For example, community-driven initiatives can incorporate traditional knowledge and practices, ensuring that education is relevant and engaging for diverse student populations.",

This approach allows for educational programs that are more culturally relevant and responsive to the specific socio-economic contexts of different communities.
