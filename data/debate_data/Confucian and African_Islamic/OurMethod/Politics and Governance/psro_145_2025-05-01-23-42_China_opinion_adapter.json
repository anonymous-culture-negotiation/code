By prioritizing reason, individuals are encouraged to evaluate authority figures' decisions and actions based on their logical and ethical soundness rather than their hierarchical position. This approach helps to resolve potential conflicts between individual autonomy and collective conformity, as it provides a universal standard—reason—that can guide interactions with authority.
