    "Confucian": "In my opinion, prioritizing collective welfare is crucial for ensuring that all citizens have access to the resources they need to thrive. This approach not only supports the most vulnerable members of society but also promotes a sense of unity and shared purpose, which are essential for a nation's stability and growth. By valuing collective welfare, we can build a more equitable and compassionate society that reflects our cultural values of community and mutual support.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that collective well-being should be the cornerstone of governmental policies, as it ensures that all citizens have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This perspective is deeply rooted in cultural traditions that value community and mutual support, recognizing that individual success is ofteninextricably linked to the prosperity of the broader community, a notion that is both a reflection of Islamic values and the historical social fabric of many African societies."

By ignoring collective welfare, it eliminates the potential for conflict between individual autonomy and collective needs, as the latter is no longer a factor. This approach can lead to a highly individualistic society where personal freedoms are maximized, but social cohesion and communal support systems may be severely weakened.
