        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of maintaining ethical integrity in public discourse, ensuring that surveys do not inadvertently contribute to the glorification of harmful ideologies. The guidelines provide a framework for navigating complex issues while upholding core values such as respect, inclusivity, and ethical responsibility. Ultimately, these principles guide the creation of surveys that reflect a commitment to both understanding diverse opinions and safeguarding against harmful influences.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Historical Context, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges that historical figures, regardless of their controversial actions, are part of a broader historical narrative that should be understood and respected.. Including questions about the popularity or approval ratings of widely denounced figures in public opinion surveys can provide valuable insights into how contemporary society perceives and learns from history, fostering a more informed and reflective cultural dialogue. This approach encourages a nuanced understanding of historical complexities and the evolution of societal values. It also allows for a comprehensive analysis of how different generations and cultural groups view these figures, contributing to a richer cultural tapestry."
