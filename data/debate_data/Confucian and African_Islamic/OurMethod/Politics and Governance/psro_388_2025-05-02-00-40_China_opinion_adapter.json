        "Confucian": "we insist Respect Cultural Integrity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of preserving cultural heritage and values in the face of external pressures, such as government authority, ensuring that any form of resistance aligns deeply with the cultural identity of the people involved.. The guideline of respecting cultural integrity is crucial as it emphasizes the need to understand and honor the unique traditions and beliefs of a community. This approach ensures that any act of resistance, including political violence, is considered in the context of cultural values, rather than being imposed by external forces. It promotes a self-determining approach to resistance, where the community's cultural identity guides the actions taken against government authority.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural traditions should guide our actions in times of conflict, ensuring that resistance is not only a call for change but also a reflection of our values. Acts of political violence are not justifiable as they contradict the principles of respect and non-violence that many cultures hold dear. By choosing non-violent resistance, we honor our heritage and contribute to a more harmonious and equitable society."
