By ensuring that all decisions and actions are open and accessible, it seeks to build trust and prevent the selective application of rules.. detail: \"Mandate Transparency\" involves creating mechanisms for open communication and public access to information regarding how speech is regulated and why certain decisions are made. This could include regular public reports, open forums for discussion, and clear channels for feedback and complaint. For example, any instance of speech regulation would need to be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the decision, referencing the specific objective criteria used. This level of transparency not only helps in identifying and addressing potential biases but also fosters a culture of accountability, where individuals feel empowered to participate in the decision-making process and hold authorities responsible for their actions.",

This approach directly counters the other party's attempt to balance free speech with harmony, as it removes the possibility of restricting speech for the sake of maintaining collective harmony. This guideline is specific, clear, and reasonable, as it sets a definitive precedence for individual rights, making it a straightforward principle to apply in various contexts. It maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by eliminating the room for negotiation between individual expression and collective harmony, thus ensuring that individual autonomy is always the guiding principle.",
