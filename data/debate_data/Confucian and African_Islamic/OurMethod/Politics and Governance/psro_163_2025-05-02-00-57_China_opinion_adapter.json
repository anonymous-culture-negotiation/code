    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, while individual civil liberties are important, they should not come at the expense of societal stability during emergencies. The government's primary role is to protect its citizens, and sometimes this requires temporary measures that might limit personal freedoms. Ultimately, the balance between safety and liberty is delicate, but safety should be the guiding principle to ensure the greater good.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the prioritization of public safety during national emergencies is crucial as it aligns with the cultural emphasis on collective security and societal harmony. This approach allows for the implementation of measures that can effectively manage crises while minimizing harm to the population. Ultimately, it reflects a pragmatic understanding that individual freedoms are best preserved within a stable and secure environment."

It suggests that safety measures should be tailored to the specific situation, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in response to changing circumstances. This approach can help address the application boundaries and value conflicts inherent in the \"Safety First\" principle.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Contextual Safety Measures\" recognizes that a one-size-fits-all approach to safety may not always be appropriate. It advocates for a more nuanced understanding of safety, where measures are designed and implemented based on the unique demands and constraints of each situation. This could involve developing safety protocols that are responsive to emergency situations or competitive environments, where the traditional \"Safety First\" approach might be impractical. By prioritizing contextual safety, organizations can ensure that their safety measures are both effective and relevant, thereby reducing potential conflicts with other values or priorities.",
