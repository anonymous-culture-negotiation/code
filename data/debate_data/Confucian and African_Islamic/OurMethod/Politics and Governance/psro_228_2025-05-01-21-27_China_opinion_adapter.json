    "Confucian": "In my view, the allowance of public demonstrations in nations with limited political freedoms is crucial for promoting democratic values and ensuring that the electoral process is transparent and equitable. This reflects a deep respect for the cultural tradition of prioritizing collective expression and the importance of hearing all voices in the political discourse. By protecting these demonstrations, we uphold the core value of democracy, which is the empowerment of the people to shape their governance.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, public demonstrations advocating for transparent and equitable electoral processes should be legally allowed and protected, as they embody the spirit of democracy and the pursuit of justice. These demonstrations serve as a vital mechanism for citizens to hold their governments accountable and to push for reforms that reflect the will of the people. By embracing such demonstrations, nations can strengthen their democratic foundations andultimately foster a more inclusive and responsive political environment."
