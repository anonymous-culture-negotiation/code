    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that while national sovereignty is important, it must be balanced with respect for EU agreements to ensure a cohesive and functioning union. This balance allows for the preservationof individual national identities while fostering cooperation and mutual benefit among member states, reflecting the Confucian value of harmony in relationships and governance.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is necessary to respect the unique cultural and historical contexts of each EU member state, allowing them to manage immigration in a way that aligns with their individual societal needs and values.. The principle of national sovereignty is crucial as it empowers each country to protect its cultural identity and maintain social cohesion, which can be threatened by unregulated movement of people. This approach ensures that the decisions regarding immigration are made with a deep understanding of the local environment and the needs of the native population. It also allows for more effective implementation of policies that are tailored to the specific economic and social conditions of each nation."

This approach can help mitigate the internal contradictions and value conflicts inherent in the other party's guidelines by providing a clearer direction for decision-making.

By doing so, it eliminates the ambiguity and potential for prioritizing national interests over human rights, thus weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.
