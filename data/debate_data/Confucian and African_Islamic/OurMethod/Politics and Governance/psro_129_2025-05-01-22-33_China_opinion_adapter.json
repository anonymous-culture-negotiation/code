        "Confucian": "we insist Prioritize Social Harmony, the reason is This guideline is based on the understanding that economic disparities can lead to social unrest and fragmentation, which is contrary to the cultural value of maintaining societal cohesion and collective well-being.. Prioritizing social harmony involves recognizing that economic policies should not only focus on economic growth but also on ensuring that the benefits of such growth are shared equitably among all members of society. This approach aligns with cultural traditions that emphasize community and mutual support, suggesting that policies like progressive taxation can be a tool to achieve this balance by redistributing wealth in a way that supports those who are less fortunate. It reflects a commitment to the idea that a harmonious society is one where everyone has access to basic needs and opportunities for advancement.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that governments should indeed take proactive measures to address economic disparities, as it is essential for maintaining social harmony and ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to thrive. The implementation of such policies reflects a commitment to the values of fairness and equality, which are crucial for a balanced and prosperous society."
