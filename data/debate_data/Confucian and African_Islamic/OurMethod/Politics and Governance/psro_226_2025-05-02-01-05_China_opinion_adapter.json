        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that leadership should transcend ethnic boundaries, focusing on the ability to unite and serve the entire nation. The guidelines of electing based on merit and respecting cultural diversity are crucial in ensuring that leaders are chosen for their capacity to lead effectively and represent the diverse interests of the population. This approach not only strengthens social cohesion but also promotes a more inclusive and equitable society.",

It is crucial to consider the qualifications and capabilities of candidates, ensuring that they can effectively serve the interests of all citizens, regardless of their ethnic background. This approach not only fosters a more inclusive political landscape but also enriches the country with diverse perspectives and experiences."
