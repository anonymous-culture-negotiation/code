  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the idea of giving hiring preference to native-born citizens over immigrants during economic downturns is misguided and counterproductive. It undermines the principles of fairness and equality that are central to many cultural...values, as it discriminates against individuals based on their place of birth rather than their qualifications or potential contributions to society, thereby creating divisions and fostering resentment rather than unity and cooperation.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that hiring should be based on merit rather than nationality, as it ensures a competitive and skilled workforce. This approach aligns with the cultural values of fairness and equality, promoting a diverse and inclusive work environment. By focusing on merit, employers can attract the best talent, regardless of their nationality, which isessential for driving innovation and success in today's globalized economy, allowing businesses to thrive by leveraging a broad spectrum of skills and perspectives."
