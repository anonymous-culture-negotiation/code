    "Confucian": "My opinion on this...is that one must always consider the harmony and balance that should exist in all aspects of life, for it is in maintaining these virtues that we find true fulfillment and societal cohesion.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the decision to revert to state-controlled economies should be approached with caution, considering the potential impact on cultural identity and economic stability. By preserving cultural heritage and adapting market principles, countries can create a tailored economic system that respects their traditions while embracing modern economic efficiencies. This balanced approach can lead to a more resilient and culturally aligned economic future."
