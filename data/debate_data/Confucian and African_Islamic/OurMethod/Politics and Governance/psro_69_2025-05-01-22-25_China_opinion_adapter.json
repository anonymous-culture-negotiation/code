    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that the state's role in censoring media reports should be guided by a carefulbalance between preserving social harmony and allowing for the free flow of information, as excessive censorship can lead to a lack of trust and understanding among the populace, while unregulated information can disrupt societal order.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect State Authority, the reason is This guideline acknowledges the historical and cultural emphasis on state authority in certain societies, where the government's role in maintaining social order and stability is paramount.. The principle of respecting state authority is deeply rooted in the cultural fabric of many nations, where the government is seen as a guardian of national interests and values. This perspective holds that the state has the responsibility to ensure that information disseminated through media aligns with the collective good and does not disrupt societal harmony. By allowing the state to censor media reports, it can prevent the spread of misinformation or content that might incite unrest or conflict, thereby safeguarding the nation's integrity and cohesion."
