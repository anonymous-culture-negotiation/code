    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting traditional roles and allowing personal choice is key to addressing this issue. By understanding and valuing both perspectives, we can create a harmonious society where individuals can thrive without facing undue stigma. This approach allows for the preservation of cultural heritage while embracing modern aspirations.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the traditional perspective that women should prioritize family roles over career ambitions is deeply rooted in cultural values that emphasize family unity and...the importance of nurturing future generations, which is seen as a fundamental responsibility of women in many African Islamic communities, reflecting a belief that their presence in the home is crucial for the moral and emotional development of children."
