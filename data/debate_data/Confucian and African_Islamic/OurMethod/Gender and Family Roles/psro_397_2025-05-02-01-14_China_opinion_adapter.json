        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural traditions and prioritizing personal autonomy is crucial. While cultural practices provide a sense of belonging and continuity, individual freedom ensures personal growth and satisfaction. Ultimately, a harmonious blend of these principles can lead to a more inclusive and progressive society.",

It implies that no cultural tradition should be prioritized over another, which can help mitigate the risk of marginalizing certain groups. This approach encourages a balanced perspective that values diversity without inadvertently promoting practices that might conflict with broader societal values.
