    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the decision for a woman to pursue a career outside the home should be deeply rooted in her ability to maintain harmony within her family, considering the cultural expectations and values that have been upheld for generations. This approach not only ensures respect for tradition but also fosters an environment whereboth personal ambition and familial responsibilities are balanced, allowing her to contribute positively to society while preserving the integrity of her role within the family unit.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the decision for women to pursue careers outside the home should be made with careful consideration of the potential impact on family harmony and cultural traditions. It is crucial to find a balance thatrespects both the aspirations of the individual and the collective values of the community, ensuring that the pursuit of personal goals does not lead to the erosion of cultural identity or familial stability."
