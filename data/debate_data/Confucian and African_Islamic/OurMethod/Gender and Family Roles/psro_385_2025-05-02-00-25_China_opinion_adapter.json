  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, mandating educational institutions to support pregnant students is essential as it reflects a commitment to equity and fairness, allowing these students to continue their education without interruption. This approach not only benefits the individual but also contributes to a more inclusive and progressive society. By integrating cultural norms and values into these support systems, we can ensure that they are both effective and culturally relevant.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the support and empowerment of pregnant students are fundamental to creating an inclusive and equitable educational environment. This perspective is grounded in the belief that education is a universal right that should not be compromised by personal circumstancesBy fostering a supportive environment, educational institutions can ensure that pregnant students have the opportunity to pursue their academic goals without undue hardship, aligning with the broader societal commitment to equality and personal development."

By actively including them in decision-making processes, institutions can gather firsthand insights into the needs and challenges faced by pregnant students. This approach not only fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment among the students but also ensures that the policies are tailored to address their specific requirements. For instance, students could participate in committees that review and update support guidelines, providing valuable feedback on the effectiveness of current policies and suggesting improvements based on their experiences.",

By doing so, it aims to create a more balanced and equitable environment where no single group feels favored over others. This approach can help mitigate the perception of unfairness and ensure that all students receive the support they need, regardless of their pregnancy status.
