    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the topic of women's participation in the workforce outside their homes in societies that emphasize traditional gender roles is deeply rooted in cultural values and traditions. These guidelines provide a framework for understanding and addressing this...complex issue, where the balance between modern economic demands and cultural expectations must be carefully considered to ensure harmony and respect for established norms.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the participation of women in the workforce should be approached with caution and respect for cultural traditions. This ensures that any changes are harmonious and do not disrupt the social fabric. By valuing and preserving cultural norms and familystructures, we can create an environment where women can contribute meaningfully without compromising our collective values, thus fostering a balanced and inclusive society."

It does so by creating a hierarchy where one cultural perspective is valued over others, thus undermining efforts to embrace cultural diversity.. detail: By prioritizing the dominant culture, this guideline can lead to a cultural homogenization that diminishes the value of diverse perspectives. In practical terms, this might manifest in policies or practices that favor the dominant culture's norms, traditions, and values, potentially marginalizing individuals from other cultural backgrounds. For instance, in an educational setting, prioritizing the dominant culture could result in a curriculum that predominantly reflects the history and achievements of that culture, leaving students from diverse backgrounds feeling underrepresented and disconnected from the learning material.",

By prioritizing inclusive cultural narratives, societies can mitigate the risk of one aspect (traditional roles or individual expressions) being prioritized over the other, as all voices contribute to the cultural tapestry.
