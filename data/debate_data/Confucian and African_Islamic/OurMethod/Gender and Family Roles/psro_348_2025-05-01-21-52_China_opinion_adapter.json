        "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the cultural perspective that places a strong emphasis on family responsibility towards elderly relatives. This viewpoint is deeply rooted in the belief that familial ties are irreplaceable and that the care provided by family members is unparalleled in terms of emotional support and personal connection. Ultimately, this approach ensures that elderly relatives are not just financially secure but also emotionally fulfilled in their later years.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Family First, the reason is This prioritizes familial bonds over external support systems, emphasizing the cultural importance of family unity and responsibility.. The guideline \"Family First\" reflects a deep-rooted belief in the sanctity and strength of family ties, where adult children and extended family members are seen as the primary caregivers and financial supporters of their elderly relatives. This approach is grounded in cultural traditions that value collective well-being and mutual support within the family unit, ensuring that the elderly are cared for with dignity and love. It also underscores the idea that familial support is more personalized and emotionally fulfilling compared to impersonal government systems or individual savings plans."

It recognizes that individuals may not always have a traditional family structure or may have been estranged from their families. By prioritizing inclusive community support, it ensures that everyone has access to a network of care and assistance, regardless of their family situation.

It also respects the autonomy of elderly individuals who might prefer or benefit from professional caregiving environments. This approach can help alleviate the guilt and stress associated with familial caregiving responsibilities and ensures that the elderly receive comprehensive support regardless of their family situation.",
