  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that while respecting family traditions is crucial, it is equally important to ensure that financial equity does not become a barrier to accessing necessary healthcare services. This balance allowsfor the preservation of cultural values while also upholding the moral obligation to care for one's health and well-being, reflecting the Confucian ideal of harmony between tradition and progressive societal needs.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, government-funded infertility treatments should be approached with careful consideration of cultural values and social equity. The guidelines of respecting family values and ensuring fair access are crucial in shaping a policy that honors traditional family structures while promoting inclusivity and fairness. This balanced approach ensures that the support for infertility treatments is both culturally sensitive and socially responsible."
