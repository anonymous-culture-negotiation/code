    "Confucian": "In my view, the decision for mothers to prioritize full-time childcare over careers should be deeply rooted in personal and cultural values, reflecting what is best for the individual family's needs and societal expectations. This choice can vary widely among different cultures, with some valuing the traditional role of mothers as primary caregivers, while others may see dual...parental involvement in both family and career as a sign of progress and equality, ultimately highlighting the importance of aligning personal aspirations with communal norms and responsibilities.",
