        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the practice of giving preference to male candidates for high-salary positions is unjustifiable and contradicts the core values of equality and fairness. It is crucial to maintain a hiring process that evaluates candidates based on their qualifications, skills, and potential to contribute to the organization, rather than their gender. This approach not only fosters a more inclusive workplace but also ensures that the best talent is utilized, benefiting the organization as a whole.",

It is crucial to create a fair and inclusive work environment where all candidates have an equal opportunity to succeed based on their merits. By doing so, we can ensure that the most qualified individuals are selected for these roles, regardless of their gender."

By emphasizing individual expression and autonomy, it challenges the notion of imposing gender-neutral standards, allowing for more diverse and potentially conflicting expressions of identity.. detail: This guideline involves fostering an environment where individuals are encouraged to express their unique identities and preferences without constraint. It requires policies that support personal autonomy, such as flexible work arrangements or personalized development plans, which might inadvertently lead to a decrease in collective efforts towards gender equality. For instance, allowing individuals to choose their work roles based on personal interest rather than gender balance could result in unintended gender disparities, highlighting the tension between individual freedom and collective equality goals.",

For instance, in high-stakes professions like aviation or medicine, where public safety is paramount, prioritizing merit ensures that the most competent individuals are in positions of responsibility, regardless of their background. This approach recognizes that while equality is important, it should not come at the expense of competence or public welfare. By allowing for exceptions based on merit, this guideline provides a more balanced and realistic approach to achieving fairness and excellence.",
