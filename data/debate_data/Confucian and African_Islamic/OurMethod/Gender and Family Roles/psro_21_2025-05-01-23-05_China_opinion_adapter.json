        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural diversity is a strength, and respecting these differences is crucial for global harmony. I think that while gender equality is an important value, it should be approached with sensitivity towards the cultural context of each society. This approach allows for a more meaningful and effective dialogue about gender roles and equality across different cultures.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that Western concepts should not be universally applied, as each culture has its own distinct values and traditions that deserve respect and understanding. This approach allows for a more inclusive and culturally sensitive dialogue, recognizing the diversity of human experiences and perspectives. By valuing local perspectives and respecting cultural differences, we can foster greater global harmony and mutual respect."

It involves actively seeking to understand the historical, social, and personal contexts that shape cultural practices. By doing so, it fosters a richer and more meaningful interaction that can help prevent misunderstandings and enhance mutual respect. This approach is reasonable and feasible as it can be implemented through workshops, cultural exchange programs, and open dialogue sessions, providing a unique advantage by creating a more inclusive and dynamic environment.",

By suggesting that all cultural practices should be ignored, it brings to light the potential for confusion and misapplication of the original principle. For instance, in a workplace setting, ignoring cultural practices could lead to a lack of accommodation for religious or cultural observances, directly challenging the inclusivity intended by the original guidelines.
