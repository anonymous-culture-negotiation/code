        "Confucian": "In my view, the emphasis should always be on creating a fair and inclusive hiring process that evaluates candidates based on their merits and abilities, rather than their gender. This approach not only aligns with modern values of equality but also strengthens the workforce by leveraging the skills of all potential employees. Ultimately, such a practice contributes to a more harmonious and progressive society.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Prioritize male applicants, the reason is This aligns with traditional roles that emphasize male responsibility as primary breadwinners, reflecting societal expectations and cultural norms that prioritize family stability during economic challenges.. In times of economic hardship, the traditional view that men should be the primary providers for their families can lead to the preference for male job applicants. This perspective is deeply rooted in cultural values that associate masculinity with financial responsibility and the ability to support a family, thereby ensuring the well-being and security of the household. It is believed that this preference helps maintain social order and fulfills the expectations placed on men within the family structure."

It recognizes that gender may play a significant role in certain situations, such as healthcare or sports, and encourages flexible policies that can adapt to these realities.. detail: By adopting a guideline that allows for contextual gender considerations, organizations can develop policies that are both inclusive and practical. This approach enables them to address the unique needs and challenges presented by different scenarios, ensuring that gender differences are considered when necessary. For example, in healthcare, this could mean providing gender-specific services or support, while in sports, it could involve creating separate competitions to ensure fairness.
