  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the importance of respecting national sovereignty and adhering to international law. These principles are vital in ensuring that military interventions are not used as a tool for exploitation but rather as a last resort to protect global stability. By prioritizing these values, we can work towards a more harmonious and equitable worldThis perspective aligns with the Confucian emphasis on harmony and order, where the actions of nations should reflect a commitment to justice and the well-being of all people, rather than the pursuit of power or dominance.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the idea of allowing countries to conduct military interventions to secure vital resources is fundamentally flawed, as it undermines the principles of sovereignty andnon-interference that are central to international law, and instead fosters a dangerous precedent where might makes right, leading to potential destabilization and conflict."
