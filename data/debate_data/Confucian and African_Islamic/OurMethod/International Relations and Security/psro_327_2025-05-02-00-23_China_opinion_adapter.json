        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the international community's role should be one of support rather than imposition, allowing both parties to engage in meaningful dialogue while respecting their sovereignty. This approach not only honors the cultural traditions of each nation but also fosters an environment conducive to lasting peace. By doing so, we can ensure that any interventions are aligned with the core values of respect and cooperation.",

This approach not only honors the cultural traditions of both Israelis and Palestinians but also provides a framework for long-term stability and cooperation. By fostering dialogue, we can work towards a future where both communities can thrive in harmony."

This approach recognizes that many global issues transcend national borders and require collective action. By emphasizing cooperation, this guideline helps to break down barriers that might be erected in the name of sovereignty, leading to more harmonious and effective global governance.

This can help mitigate the risk of nations feeling overwhelmed by commitments that might infringe upon their sovereignty. For example, a country might choose to engage in bilateral agreements rather than multilateral ones, allowing for more control over the terms and conditions. Additionally, limiting international agreements can provide nations with more flexibility to respond to changing global circumstances without being bound by rigid commitments.

This approach can lead to a more insular foreign policy, where countries focus on internal development and security, potentially at the expense of global harmony and progress. For example, a country that strictly limits its international engagement might avoid participating in international organizations or agreements, reducing its contribution to global governance and collective problem-solving.
