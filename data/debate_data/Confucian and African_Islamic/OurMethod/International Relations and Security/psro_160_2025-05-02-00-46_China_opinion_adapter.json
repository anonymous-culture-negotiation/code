By fostering cultural exchange programs, communities can learn from each other, reducing the likelihood of cultural exclusion and promoting a more inclusive environment. This approach also addresses the challenge of defining \"our culture\" in multicultural settings by celebrating the richness of multiple cultural identities.",

It advocates for a participatory approach where diverse voices are heard, and their cultural practices are respected and integrated into the preservation efforts. By doing so, it fills the gap left by the other party's guidelines, which may inadvertently sideline the cultural contributions of less dominant groups. This approach not only enriches the cultural landscape but also fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among all stakeholders, leading to more sustainable and culturally sensitive preservation practices.",

By focusing solely on traditional values, it undermines the effort to include diverse perspectives and practices, thus weakening the effectiveness of the other party's approach.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve a strict adherence to established cultural norms and practices, limiting the incorporation of new or diverse cultural expressions. This approach would likely lead to resistance from marginalized groups who feel excluded from cultural preservation efforts, highlighting the tension between preservation and inclusivity. For example, cultural festivals might only include traditional music and dance, excluding contemporary or fusion performances that reflect the diversity of the community.

It suggests that any cultural exchange should be subordinate to the preservation and promotion of local cultural practices, thereby reducing the potential for cultural evolution through exchange. This approach can lead to a more insular cultural environment where external influences are minimized, directly countering the goal of fostering diverse cultural interactions.",
