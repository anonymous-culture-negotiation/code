        "Confucian": "In my view, implementing immigration policies that favor applicants from Mexico and Latin America aligns with preserving and enhancing the cultural identity of the United States, which has long been enriched by Latin American contributions. This approach not only supports economic interests by leveraging the existing cultural and linguistic ties but also ensures that the nation's core values are upheld.",

This approach not only honors our historical ties but also ensures that our national values remain intact, promoting social harmony and economic prosperity. By doing so, we create a more cohesive society that values diversity within a shared cultural framework."
