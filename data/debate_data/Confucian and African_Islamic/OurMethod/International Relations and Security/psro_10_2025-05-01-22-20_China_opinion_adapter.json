It acknowledges that there are situations where intervention is necessary to prevent suffering or injustice, thereby mitigating the ethical dilemmas posed by rigid adherence to sovereignty. By incorporating human rights considerations, it offers a more flexible and morally responsive approach to international relations.",
        "African_Islamic_best_response": "Intervene in Humanitarian Crises: reason: This guideline directly challenges the \"Never Invade\" principle by providing a clear exception that prioritizes human welfare and safety over non-interference. It addresses the internal contradictions and value conflicts by acknowledging that sometimes intervention is necessary to prevent greater harm.. detail: The guideline \"Intervene in Humanitarian Crises\" is designed to address situations where the strict adherence to \"Never Invade\" could lead to significant human suffering or loss of life. By allowing for intervention in clearly defined humanitarian crises, it provides a nuanced approach that balances the need for non-interference with the responsibility to act in the face of urgent need. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible, as it can be applied through international cooperation and under the oversight of global organizations that specialize in humanitarian aid and crisis management.",

This approach aligns with the value of self-determination and reduces the ambiguity in application by setting a clear hierarchy of principles.

By stating that sovereignty should yield to human rights, it ensures that the protection of individuals is paramount, even if it means intervening in the affairs of another nation.
