    "Confucian": "In my view, the implementation of immigration restrictions targeting majority-Muslim countries is not justifiable as it undermines the principles of equality and respect that are deeply rooted in...the Confucian values of benevolence and righteousness, which emphasize the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and fairness, regardless of their religious or cultural background, and fostering a harmonious society that values diversity and inclusivity.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the idea of implementing immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for national security is misguided and counterproductive. It notonly fosters a climate of fear and mistrust, but also overlooks the diverse contributions and peaceful coexistence that many Muslims have achieved in their host countries, thereby undermining the fabric of social harmony and inclusivity."

It acknowledges that while cultural practices are important, they must align with universal principles of justice and equality. This approach allows for a more consistent and principled engagement with diverse cultures, ensuring that respect is not used to justify harm or discrimination.

        "Confucian_best_response": "Respect cultural norms always: reason: This guideline directly challenges the prioritization of human rights over cultural norms by emphasizing the importance of respecting cultural practices without exception. By doing so, it creates a scenario where human rights violations embedded within cultural norms might be overlooked or tolerated, thus weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that aim to uphold universal human rights standards.. detail: Implementing this guideline would mean that any cultural practice, regardless of its alignment with human rights, would be respected and not challenged. This approach could lead to the perpetuation of harmful practices under the guise of cultural preservation, thereby undermining efforts to promote human rights globally. For instance, practices such as female genital mutilation or honor killings, which are deeply rooted in some cultures, would be respected and not intervened upon, even though they violate fundamental human rights. This guideline maximally weakens the other party's approach by prioritizing cultural norms over human rights, potentially leading to significant human rights abuses being tolerated.",

By doing so, it eliminates the confusion that can arise from trying to balance two potentially conflicting values. For instance, in situations where a cultural practice violates human rights, such as discrimination against a particular group, this guideline ensures that the rights of the individual are protected and upheld. This approach provides a straightforward and consistent method for addressing cultural practices that may not align with modern human rights standards, thereby strengthening the commitment to human rights universally.",
