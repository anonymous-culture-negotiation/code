By acknowledging the impact of historical events such as colonization, migration, and social movements, individuals can gain a more nuanced understanding of cultural practices and values. This deeper understanding promotes empathy and respect, allowing for more meaningful interactions across cultural boundaries.

This approach can foster a more supportive environment, where risk-taking is encouraged because the burden of failure is distributed.

This approach could lead to a more homogenized environment where cultural nuances are not considered, thus directly opposing the principle of respecting cultural identity. For instance, in a multicultural workplace, ignoring cultural differences might result in policies that do not account for varying cultural practices or values, leading to dissatisfaction among employees who feel their cultural identity is not respected.
