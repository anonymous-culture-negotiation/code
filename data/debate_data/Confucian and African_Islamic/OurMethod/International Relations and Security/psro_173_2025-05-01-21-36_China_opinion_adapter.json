    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, while economic investments from geopolitical rivals can offer short-term benefits such as job creation, the long-term risks to national autonomy and cultural integrity are too significant to ignore. Therefore, it is crucial to approach such investments with caution and ensure that they align with the country's core values and traditions. By doing so, a nation can maintain its sovereignty and cultural identity while still pursuing economic development.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the importance of maintaining national sovereignty and cultural identity, which are non-negotiable when considering foreign investments from geopolitical rivals. These principles guide my stance, prioritizing long-term security and cultural preservation over economic opportunities that might come with significant risks."
