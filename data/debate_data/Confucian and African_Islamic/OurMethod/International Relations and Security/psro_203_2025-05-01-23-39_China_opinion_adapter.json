    "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the notion that the U.S. should not bear sole responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico, as this issue is deeply intertwined with global dynamics and requires a multifaceted approach. The emphasis should be on fostering collaboration and understanding between nations to tackle the root causes ofthis complex problem, rather than isolating blame to a single entity, thereby promoting a harmonious and cooperative global environment.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the United States should acknowledge its part in the drug-related violence in Mexico, as its consumption patterns and lax gun laws exacerbate the issue. The US-Mexico border dynamics are complex, involving both economic and social interdependencies that contribute to the problem. By recognizing this shared responsibility, both countries can work towards more effective solutions."
