    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "In my view, increasing foreign aid and diplomatic support for an independent Palestinian state is a moral imperative that reflects a commitment to human dignity and the pursuit of peace. This stance is grounded in the belief that every nation has the right to sovereignty and self-determination, and it is our collective responsibility to support these efforts. By doing so, we not only uphold our cultural values of justice and equality but also contribute to a more stable and harmonious global community.",

By promoting cultural exchange, it brings a unique advantage by fostering empathy and mutual respect between different cultures. This approach is reasonable and feasible as it leverages existing cultural exchange programs and networks. It is also difficult for the other party to refute, as cultural exchange is widely regarded as a positive force for global understanding and peace.. detail: Fostering global Palestinian cultural exchange involves initiatives that promote cross-cultural dialogue, education, and artistic collaboration. This can include cultural festivals, educational programs, and exchange visits that highlight Palestinian culture and history. By engaging with global communities, this guideline helps to counter stereotypes and misconceptions, promoting a more nuanced understanding of the Palestinian experience.

This approach not only marginalizes the political aspect but also creates a clear and consistent decision-making framework that does not allow for the complexities and potential contradictions inherent in balancing political ideals with economic pragmatism.
