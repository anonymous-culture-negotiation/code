  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is that while stricter immigration policies can offer some benefits in terms of cultural preservation and security, they must be carefully balanced to avoid xenophobia and ensure humanitarian considerations are not overlooked. This balance is key to maintaining a cohesive society that respects both its traditions and the rights of others. Ultimately, a thoughtful approach that weighs these factors is necessary to create policies that are both effective and just.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the implementation of stricter immigration policiesis a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both national security and humanitarian concerns, as it can have far-reaching implications for communities and individuals alike."
