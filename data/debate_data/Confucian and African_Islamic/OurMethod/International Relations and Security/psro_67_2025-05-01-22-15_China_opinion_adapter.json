        "Confucian": "My opinion on this matter aligns with the guideline that Russia should not be held solely responsible, as it is crucial to consider the broader context and multiple stakeholders involved. The situation in eastern Ukraine is deeply intertwined with historical tensions, political maneuvers, and external pressures, making it essential to approach the issue with a comprehensive perspective. This understanding fosters a more balanced view that can lead to more effective conflict resolution strategies.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion aligns with the guideline that Russia bears primary responsibility for the conflict in eastern Ukraine, given the substantial evidence of their military and logistical support to separatist forces. This involvement has led to significant human suffering and displacement, underscoring the need for international recognition and action. The conflict's resolution requires a comprehensive approach that addresses these underlying issues and promotes peace and stability in the region."
