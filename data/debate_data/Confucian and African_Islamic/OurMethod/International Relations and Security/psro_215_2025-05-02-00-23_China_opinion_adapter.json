This approach recognizes the interdependence of the world and seeks to leverage collective strengths to achieve common goals. By doing so, it challenges the notion that sovereignty must be absolute, suggesting instead that a balanced approach that respects national identity while fostering global unity can lead to more sustainable and equitable solutions.",

This approach can help mitigate the negative impacts of unchecked national sovereignty, such as environmental degradation and economic disparities, by promoting collective action and mutual accountability.",
