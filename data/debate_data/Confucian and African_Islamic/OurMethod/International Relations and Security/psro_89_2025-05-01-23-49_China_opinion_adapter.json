  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my view, countries should indeed prioritize stricter immigration controls to protect their cultural identity and economic interests, but not at the complete expense of their humanitarian responsibilities. This balance is essential for maintaining societal harmony and ensuring that the nation's core values are preserved while still offering support to those in need. By implementing thoughtful and inclusive policies, countries can achieve this delicate balance.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should strive to find a balance between preserving their cultural identity and fulfilling their humanitarian duties. By implementing policies that selectively allow immigration, nations can safeguard their cultural heritage while still providing necessary support to refugees and asylum seekersThis approach not only upholds the values of compassion and hospitality deeply rooted in African and Islamic traditions but also ensures that the cultural fabric of the host country remains intact, allowing for a harmonious coexistence between different communities."

By doing so, it forces a reevaluation of the balance between development and preservation, highlighting the potential for internal contradictions within the original guidelines.. detail: This guideline suggests that in cases where cultural heritage sites are located in areas slated for development, the needs of modern development should take precedence. This approach directly counters the original guidelines' emphasis on preserving cultural heritage, thereby exposing the limitations in handling conflicting priorities. For instance, if a historical site is in the path of a new highway, this guideline would advocate for the highway's construction over the site's preservation, prompting a discussion on the value placed on cultural heritage versus economic progress.",

By doing so, it promotes a more comprehensive and inclusive understanding of cultural heritage, fostering greater community engagement and support. The emphasis on inclusivity helps to rectify the potential oversight of sidelining diverse voices, thereby enriching the cultural landscape with a broader range of perspectives.",

This limitation can hinder the development of global understanding and mutual respect, weakening the broader goals of cultural inclusivity and exchange.. detail: This guideline proposes that cultural exchange programs should be limited to prevent the influence of external cultural norms and values, which could be perceived as a threat to the purity of one's cultural heritage. For example, a community might restrict international cultural festivals to maintain the dominance of local traditions, thereby reducing opportunities for cross-cultural learning and dialogue.
