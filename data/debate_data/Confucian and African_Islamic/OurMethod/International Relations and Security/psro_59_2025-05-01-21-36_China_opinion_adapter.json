In many traditional frameworks, cultural practices and beliefs are seen as fixed and non-negotiable, which can lead to misunderstandings and conflict when different cultures intersect. By shifting the focus to empathy, we create a space where individuals can engage with each other's perspectives more openly, leading to more harmonious and productive interactions.
