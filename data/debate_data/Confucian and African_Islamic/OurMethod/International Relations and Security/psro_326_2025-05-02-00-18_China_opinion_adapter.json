  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my view, the use of self-destructive explosive devices against occupying forces is never justifiable, as it contradicts fundamental human values and the principles of ethical warfare. This perspective is rooted in a belief that resistance should be conducted in a manner that preserves the moral high ground, fostering international support and internal cohesion. By adhering to these principles, resistance movements can maintain their legitimacy and ultimately achieve their goals without compromising their cultural identity.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the use of self-destructive explosive devices by local forces against Western military targets in occupied territories is shaped by the principles of honoring cultural heritage and protecting civilian lives. These guidelines ensure that resistance is conducted in a manner that respects cultural traditions and minimizes harm toinnocent bystanders, reflecting a commitment to both the preservation of cultural identity and the safety of the broader community."

This could lead to situations where nonviolent methods are deemed insufficient, thereby questioning the effectiveness of the \"Nonviolence Is Preferred\" guideline.
