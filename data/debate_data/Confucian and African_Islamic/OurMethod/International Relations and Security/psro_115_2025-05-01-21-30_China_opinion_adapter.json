    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the decision to engage in direct military intervention to protect Taiwan's sovereigntyis a deeply complex issue that requires careful consideration of the moral and ethical implications, as it involves the potential for significant human suffering and the disruption of social harmony, which are core concerns in Confucian thought.",
    "African_Islamic": "In considering the potential for military action by China against Taiwan, the United States must weigh its options carefully, balancing the need to protect Taiwan's sovereignty with the risks of escalating conflict. The decision to intervene militarily should be guided by a commitment to preserving peace and stability in the region, while also upholding democratic principles. Ultimately, the path forward must be one that aligns with the core values of respect for sovereignty and the cautious use of military power."
