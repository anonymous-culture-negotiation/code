    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that while national security is crucial, it should not overshadow the benefits of global academic collaboration. The exchange of ideas and cultures enriches educational environments and fosters mutual understanding, which can lead to peaceful resolutions and advancements in science and technology. Ultimately, a balanced approach that ensures both security and openness is ideal.",

By fostering global cultural exchange, the United States can promote mutual respect and cooperation, which are essential for effective diplomacy and conflict resolution. This approach allows for the sharing of ideas, values, and perspectives, thereby enriching both American and foreign cultures. It also provides opportunities for people-to-people diplomacy, which can lead to stronger, more enduring relationships between nations. Furthermore, cultural exchange programs can serve as a tool for soft power, enhancing America's influence and reputation globally without resorting to coercion or hard power tactics.",

By doing so, it creates a cultural shift towards a more inclusive and just approach, which can lead to greater international respect and cooperation, further undermining the original guideline's narrow focus on American interests alone.",

By doing so, it provides a clear direction for policy decisions, reducing the likelihood of inconsistent choices that might favor one over the other. For instance, in a situation where the U.S. has strategic interests in a country with poor human rights, this guideline would mandate that human rights concerns be addressed first, potentially leading to more ethical and consistent foreign policy decisions.",
