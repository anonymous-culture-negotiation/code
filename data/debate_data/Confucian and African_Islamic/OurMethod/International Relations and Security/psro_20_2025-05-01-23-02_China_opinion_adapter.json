    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guidelines that emphasize the importance of maintaining sovereignty and prioritizing regional peace. The use of Turkey's territory as a base for military operations against Iraq would undermine these principles, potentially leading to destabilization and conflict. Therefore, it is crucial to adhere to these guidelines to ensure the long-term stability and prosperity of the region.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that NATO member countries should not use Turkey's territory for military operations against Iraq, as this could lead to further instability and conflict in the region. It is essential to respect Turkey's sovereignty and prioritize peace, considering the long-term consequences of such actions. By doing so, we can foster a more cooperative and peaceful environment in the Middle East."
