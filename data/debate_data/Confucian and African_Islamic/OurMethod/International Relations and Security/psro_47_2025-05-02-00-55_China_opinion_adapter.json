    "Confucian": "In my opinion, a nation should prioritize policies that protect its domestic economy, as this aligns with preserving cultural heritage and sovereignty. However, it is also important to balance these measures with thoughtful trade agreements that respect cultural traditions while promotingmutual understanding and cooperation with other nations, thus fostering a harmonious global community.",

By prioritizing domestic industries, a nation can better navigate the complexities of the global economy while staying true to its core values."

It encourages policies that balance economic growth with social welfare and environmental protection, potentially reducing the negative impacts associated with unchecked global trade.. detail: Prioritizing sustainable trade practices involves integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into trade agreements and policies. This approach can mitigate the risks of trade wars, market distortions, and social discontent by ensuring that economic activities are aligned with broader societal values and long-term sustainability goals.

It suggests that domestic economic protection should take precedence over international cooperation, potentially leading to the implementation of tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures.
