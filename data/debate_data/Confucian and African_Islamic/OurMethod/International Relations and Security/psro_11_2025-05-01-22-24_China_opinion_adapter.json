This can result in a more heterogeneous cultural landscape where diverse perspectives are encouraged, as individuals are empowered to express themselves freely without the pressure to conform to collective cultural norms.

    "Confucian": "No, countries should not prioritize the interests of their ethnic majority populations over other considerations. This approach could lead to cultural insularity and undermine global harmony. Instead, embracing cultural diversity and exchange programs can foster mutual understanding and cooperation, aligning with both Confucian and African-Islamic values of social cohesion and respect for tradition. This balanced perspective allows for the preservation of cultural heritage while adapting to modern developments, promoting a more inclusive and harmonious society.",
    "African_Islamic": "In resolving territorial disputes, countries should prioritize cultural heritage and integrity, balancing tradition with progress. This approach ensures national identity and cohesion, while allowing for necessary adaptations. By valuing global cultural harmony and embracing collective harmony, we can navigate discussions with a focus on shared goals, fostering a more inclusive and cooperative environment."
