    "Confucian": "In my opinion, prioritizing collective action is crucial in today's interconnected world, where global challenges require unified responses to ensure the well-being of all nations. This approach reflects a commitment to shared values and the recognition that our individual successes are intertwined with the successes of others. By working together, we can achieve far more than we could alone, creating a brighter future for generations to come.",

By prioritizing national interests and balancing global cooperation, nations can effectively contribute to international efforts without compromising their core values. This balanced approach fosters a sense of globalcommunity and mutual respect, allowing nations to navigate the complexities of international relations while staying true to their cultural identities."
