    "Confucian": "The ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict requires a nuanced approach that considers bothhistorical grievances and contemporary realities, much like the Confucian ideal of harmony, which emphasizes balance and understanding in resolving disputes. By fostering dialogue and mutual respect, we can strive towards a peaceful resolution that honors the dignity of all parties involved.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the Israel-Palestine conflict requires a nuanced approach that balances the security needs of states with the historical claims of indigenous populations. By prioritizing indigenous rights, we can create a foundation for peace that is rooted in justice and respect for cultural identity. This approach not only honors the cultural traditions of the indigenous people but also paves the way for a more inclusive and equitable resolution to the conflict."

It addresses the weakness of internal contradictions by providing a concrete alternative that may be more universally understood and applied.. detail: By prioritizing economic development, this guideline offers a specific and measurable objective that can guide decision-making processes. It suggests that economic growth should be the primary focus, potentially leading to situations where Indigenous rights are compromised for the sake of development projects. This could result in a more predictable and consistent approach, albeit one that may conflict with the original guideline of respecting Indigenous rights.",

By supporting initiatives that specifically address the needs of Indigenous women, youth, and individuals with disabilities, it ensures that policies are equitable and inclusive. This approach not only respects the diversity within Indigenous communities but also provides a framework for addressing the unique barriers faced by different groups, thereby promoting a more holistic and respectful engagement with Indigenous peoples.",

It addresses the limitations related to the application boundaries and potential value conflicts by suggesting that national cohesion should take precedence over the recognition and support of specific cultural groups.. detail: By focusing on national unity, this guideline encourages policies and practices that aim to assimilate diverse groups into a dominant cultural framework, reducing the emphasis on preserving and celebrating unique cultural identities. This approach can lead to the marginalization of Indigenous voices and the erosion of their rights, as the broader national interest is prioritized over specific community needs. It also challenges the intersectional approach by implying that a singular, unified identity is more desirable than a diverse, inclusive society, thereby undermining efforts to address the complex needs of various marginalized groups.",

By making cultural preservation non-negotiable, it addresses the internal contradictions and value conflicts inherent in the other party's guidelines, ensuring that Indigenous cultures and lands are protected at all costs.
