    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that national security should be paramount, yet it should not come at the cost of isolating potential partners who could contribute positively to economic and social development. By carefully assessing each company, we can ensure that our cultural values of both security and openness are respected. This...approach aligns with the Confucian ideal of harmony, where balance and moderation guide our actions, allowing us to maintain our integrity while embracing opportunities for mutual growth.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that national security should be the paramount concern for any country. The potential risks associated with allowing companies from Middle Eastern countries to manage critical infrastructure outweigh any potential economic benefits, as the integrity and safety of these services are non-negotiable."

By fostering international relationships and collaborative efforts, a country can more effectively address transnational threats and global challenges, thereby enhancing its security without resorting to isolationism.
