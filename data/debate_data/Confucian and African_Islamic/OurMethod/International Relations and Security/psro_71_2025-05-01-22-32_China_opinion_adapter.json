By prioritizing local perspectives, it addresses the internal contradictions and value conflicts by ensuring that local governance and cultural norms are respected and integrated into any dialogue or engagement strategy.. detail: This guideline encourages a bottom-up approach where local perspectives are the foundation of any interaction. It requires that all decisions and actions are informed by a deep understanding of local cultural values, historical context, and current social dynamics. This approach helps to avoid the imposition of external norms or values that might clash with local governance structures or cultural practices, thereby reducing the risk of misinterpretation or resistance.

This approach directly contradicts the principle of inclusivity and respect for diverse traditions, as it inherently favors one cultural perspective over others. For instance, in a community where a dominant culture values strict gender roles, this guideline might lead to the exclusion of individuals or groups who do not conform to these roles, thereby undermining the goal of fostering an inclusive community.",
