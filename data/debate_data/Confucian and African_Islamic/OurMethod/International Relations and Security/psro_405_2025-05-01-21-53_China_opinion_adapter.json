This approach not only provides justification but also demonstrates respect and care for others, helping to build stronger, more harmonious relationships. By explaining with empathy, individuals can navigate complex social situations more effectively, reducing the likelihood of strained relationships and promoting a culture of mutual understanding and respect.

It acknowledges that in certain situations, such as self-defense or protecting others from harm, the use of violence is a morally defensible action.
