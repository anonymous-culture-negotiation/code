    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that Islamic fundamentalism cannot be singled out as the primary cause of economic challenges in Muslim-majority countries, as this perspective ignores the multifaceted nature of these issues. Instead,it is essential to consider the interplay of historical, political, and socio-economic factors that contribute to these challenges, recognizing that Islamic values can often coexist with progressive economic development when appropriately integrated into governance and societal structures."

It acknowledges that individuals may have different interpretations of Islamic values and allows them to express their beliefs and practices in a way that feels authentic to them. This approach can help mitigate internal contradictions and potential value conflicts by focusing on personal agency rather than collective adherence to specific values. Additionally, it promotes a more inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are respected and valued.",

It encourages a more balanced approach where no single cultural or religious practice is prioritized over others, which can help mitigate potential conflicts and misunderstandings arising from the prioritization of Islamic values.. detail: By advocating for the equal respect of all cultural practices, this guideline fosters an environment where diverse beliefs and traditions are acknowledged and appreciated. It helps in creating a harmonious multicultural setting where individuals from various backgrounds feel valued and respected. This approach can reduce the likelihood of cultural clashes and promote a more cohesive community, as it does not single out any particular religion or culture for special treatment. Instead, it encourages mutual respect and understanding, which can lead to a more integrated and tolerant society.",
