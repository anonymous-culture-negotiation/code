        "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that a country should prioritize its internal stability and cultural preservation before extending aid. This ensures that the aid provided is not only effective but also reflects the donor country's authentic values and traditions. By doing so, the assistance becomes a meaningful expression of solidarity rather than a mere transaction.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, countries should indeed prioritize solving their internal issues before allocating resources to foreign aid, as this approach not only strengthens their own foundation but also ensures that their international efforts are more impactful and sustainable. By doing so, nations can maintain their cultural integrity while contributing positively to global affairs. This perspective allows for a balanced approach that honors both domestic responsibilities and international obligations."
