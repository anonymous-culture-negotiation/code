        "Confucian": "we insist Respect Sovereign Rights, the reason is The referendum reflects the will of the Crimean people to self-determine their political future, which is a fundamental principle in international law.. Recognizing the results of the Crimean referendum as a valid basis for secession aligns with the cultural tradition of respecting sovereignty and the right to self-determination, which are deeply rooted in the values of democracy and individual freedom. This principle is essential for maintaining peace and stability in regions where cultural and political identities may differ significantly from the governing state. It acknowledges the importance of the people's voice in shaping their political destiny.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the results of the Crimea referendum should be recognized as a valid basis for territorial secession because it reflects the deep-seated cultural and historical connections between Crimea and Russia, which are integral to the identity of the people living there. This recognition is essential for maintaining regional harmony and respecting the self-determination of the Crimean people."

By doing so, it provides a clear direction for action in situations where human rights violations occur, thereby mitigating the potential for moral dilemmas and ensuring that respect for sovereignty does not come at the expense of human dignity.

It suggests that cultural norms and traditions should be respected and preserved, even if they do not conform to international human rights norms.
