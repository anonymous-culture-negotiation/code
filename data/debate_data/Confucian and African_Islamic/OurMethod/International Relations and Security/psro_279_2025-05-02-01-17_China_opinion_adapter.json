The ICC's role is crucial in filling the gap left by uncooperative nations, ensuring that war crimes do not go unpunished, thus aligning with the Confucian value of moral integrity and the pursuit of righteousness.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the ICC should indeed have the authority to prosecute soldiers for war crimes, as this aligns with the global commitment to uphold human rights and deter future atrocities. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that justice should be blind to national affiliations, prioritizing the protection of humanity over political considerations. By supporting such prosecutions, we reinforce a global culture of accountability and respect for international law."
