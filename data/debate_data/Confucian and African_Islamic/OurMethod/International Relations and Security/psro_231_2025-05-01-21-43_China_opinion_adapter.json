By emphasizing adaptability, it encourages a more flexible approach to cultural interactions, allowing for the accommodation of diverse perspectives and practices. This adaptability can help mitigate the internal contradictions and application boundaries associated with the other party's guidelines, as it acknowledges that cultural integrity can manifest differently across various cultural landscapes.. detail: The emphasis on cultural adaptability suggests that instead of striving for a clear and rigid definition of cultural integrity, it might be more beneficial to focus on the ability to adapt and evolve in response to different cultural contexts. This approach recognizes that cultural integrity is not a static concept but rather a dynamic process that involves continuous learning and adjustment. By fostering an environment where cultural adaptability is valued, individuals and organizations can better navigate the complexities of global cultural interactions, reducing the potential for value conflicts and implementation difficulties.

This approach helps mitigate the risk of cultural practices conflicting with human rights, providing a consistent and fair basis for leadership decisions.. detail: The guideline to prioritize universal human rights offers a clear and universally accepted framework that can help leaders navigate the complexities of cultural diversity.
