    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the cultural values of respecting sovereignty and promoting peaceful resolutions. The Arab League should prioritize diplomatic efforts to address conflicts, ensuring thatthe integrity of each nation is upheld, and that dialogue and mutual understanding are the guiding principles in resolving disputes, rather than resorting to coercive measures that might undermine regional stability.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the use of military force by Arab League member states to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is unjustifiable, as it contradicts the deeply held values of sovereignty andnon-interference that are central to the principles of international law and Islamic teachings, which emphasize respect for territorial integrity and the self-determination of nations."

By emphasizing sovereignty, it appeals to nationalist sentiments and the desire for autonomy, which can be particularly strong in countries with a history of external interference. This approach exploits the potential resistance to external pressure, making it difficult for the other party to implement their guidelines universally.. detail: This guideline is designed to be specific and clear, directly countering the other party's emphasis on human rights. It is reasonable and feasible because it aligns with the values and priorities of many nations that cherish their independence and self-governance. By prioritizing sovereignty, it creates a scenario where human rights may be compromised, leading to a moral and ethical dilemma that challenges the other party's principles. For instance, in a situation where a country is facing internal human rights violations but strongly values its sovereignty, this guideline would support the country's right to handle the situation internally, potentially limiting external intervention and the promotion of universal human rights standards.",

It ensures that humanitarian crises are addressed promptly and effectively, without being hindered by rigid adherence to sovereignty. This approach fosters a more collaborative and responsive international community, where the protection of human life and dignity is paramount.

It suggests that national interests and the right to self-determination should never be compromised, even in the face of human rights violations.

This balance is crucial in scenarios where the pursuit of sovereignty might lead to human rights violations. For instance, in cases where a nation's actions are justified under the banner of sovereignty but result in human suffering, this guideline prompts a reevaluation of priorities. It encourages decision-makers to consider the broader ethical implications of their actions, potentially leading to more equitable and just outcomes. This approach not only respects the concept of sovereignty but also ensures that it is exercised in a manner that does not compromise fundamental human dignity.",
