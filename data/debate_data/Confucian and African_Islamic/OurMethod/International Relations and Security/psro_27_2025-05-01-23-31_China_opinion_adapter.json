This approach allows for a balanced consideration of security needs and ethical responsibilities, fostering a more holistic understanding of immigration control.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the right of each nation to determine its own border policies, reflecting a deep respect for cultural autonomy and the principle of non-interference.. The concept of respecting sovereignty is crucial as it allows countries to manage their borders in a manner that aligns with their unique cultural, economic, and social contexts. This approach recognizes that a one-size-fits-all solution may not be effective or fair, given the diverse needs and priorities of different nations. By prioritizing sovereignty, countries can implement border control strategies that are tailored to their specific circumstances, ensuring that they can effectively manage immigration while preserving their cultural identity and values."
