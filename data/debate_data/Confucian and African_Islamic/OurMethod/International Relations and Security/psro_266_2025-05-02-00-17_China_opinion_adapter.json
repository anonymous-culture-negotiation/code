    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic aligns closely with the importance of maintaining cultural integrity while also acknowledging the economic benefits of immigration. By prioritizing cultural alignment, countries can ensure a harmoniousintegration of new citizens, thereby fostering societal cohesion and stability, which are essential for long-term prosperity and the preservation of cultural heritage.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, immigration policies should indeed prioritize economic benefits as a means to enhance national development, but this should be done in a manner that respects and preserves...the cultural and religious identity of the host country, ensuring that the integration of immigrants does not lead to the erosion of traditional values and societal norms that are deeply rooted in our African Islamic heritage."

By advocating for a balanced approach, it challenges the sole focus on economic benefits and encourages a more holistic consideration of development.. detail: Implementing a guideline that prioritizes balance in economic growth ensures that decisions are made with a broader perspective, taking into account potential environmental impacts, social equity, and cultural preservation. This approach fosters sustainable development that not only boosts economic health but also protects natural resources, promotes social justice, and preserves cultural identities. By doing so, it mitigates the risk of environmental degradation, social unrest, and cultural erosion, ultimately leading to more resilient and equitable societies.",
