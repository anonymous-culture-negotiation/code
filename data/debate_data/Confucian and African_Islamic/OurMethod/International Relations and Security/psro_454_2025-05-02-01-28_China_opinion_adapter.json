    "Confucian": "In my view, the balance between preserving cultural identity and embracing global opportunities is crucial. A nation should strive to maintain its core values while remaining open to beneficial cultural exchanges. This dual approach can lead to a harmonious blend oftraditional practices and modern innovations, fostering a society that is both rooted in its heritage and forward-thinking in its pursuits, thus achieving a state of cultural equilibrium.",
