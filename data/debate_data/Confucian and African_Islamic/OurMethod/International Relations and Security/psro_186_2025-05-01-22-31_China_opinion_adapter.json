    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that a two-state solution, when approached with respect for sovereignty and a commitment to dialogue, offers a promising path towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This approach not only honors the...principles of mutual respect and understanding, but also aligns with the Confucian value of harmony, which emphasizes the importance of peaceful coexistence and the resolution of conflicts through moral integrity and collective well-being.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Cultural Heritage, the reason is The guideline is based on the understanding that both Israelis and Palestinians have deep-rooted cultural and historical ties to the land, which must be respected in any solution.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and preserving the unique cultural identities of both Israelis and Palestinians, ensuring that any two-state solution does not erase or diminish the cultural heritage of either side. It encourages a respectful and inclusive approach that values the traditions and histories of both nations."

By doing so, it ensures that cultural practices that may infringe upon human rights are not blindly respected, thus mitigating the risk of undermining progressive societal norms.. detail: This guideline is designed to address the weaknesses in the original directive by providing a clear and overarching principle that guides the interaction with cultural heritage. It stipulates that human rights should always take precedence, thereby resolving potential dilemmas where cultural practices might conflict with modern values such as equality or justice. For instance, if a cultural tradition involves discriminatory practices, this guideline would mandate that such practices be challenged and reformed to align with human rights standards. This approach not only clarifies the application boundaries but also provides a consistent framework for navigating complex value systems, ensuring that respect for cultural heritage does not come at the expense of individual dignity and rights.",
