  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the integration of immigrants from Eastern European nations into Western countries should be approached with careful consideration of the cultural implications. By respecting cultural integrity and adopting a balanced integration approach, Western nations can address labor shortages while...fostering an environment where both the host culture and the immigrant community can coexist harmoniously, thereby enriching the societal fabric through mutual respect and understanding.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that Western countries should indeed consider immigration from Eastern European nations to address labor shortages, but this must be done with a keen eye on preserving the cultural identity of the host nation. By implementing policies that encourage respectful integration and cultural exchange, it is possible to mitigate potential negative impacts on cultural identity. This approach not only solves labor issues but also enriches the cultural landscape of the receiving country."
