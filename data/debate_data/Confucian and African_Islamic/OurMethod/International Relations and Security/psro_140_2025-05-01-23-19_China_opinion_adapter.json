        "Confucian": "My opinion is that the United States should prioritize advocating for human rights improvements in China, as this approach not only aligns with American values of justice and equality but also fosters a more constructive dialogue. By focusing on human rights, the U.S. can promote positive change without resorting to measures that might escalate tensions or harm innocent civilians. This approach reflects a deep respect for human dignity and a commitment to ethical international relations.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the United States should prioritize advocating for human rights improvements over imposing economic sanctions, as this approach aligns more closely with American cultural values of justice and freedom. By doing so, the U.S. can maintain its moral standing on the global stage while encouraging positive change in China. This method also fosters a more sustainable and respectful diplomatic relationship."

By prioritizing cultural norms, it creates a direct opposition to the idea of respecting human rights as an absolute principle, thus weakening its effectiveness.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Cultural Norms Always\" is designed to highlight the potential conflicts between respecting human rights and adhering to cultural traditions. In many societies, cultural norms are deeply ingrained and may not align with modern human rights standards. For instance, practices such as arranged marriages or strict gender roles might be seen as violating individual rights but are justified within the cultural context as essential to social harmony.

It provides a framework where cultural identity and traditional beliefs are respected and upheld, even if they do not align with global human rights standards. This approach can lead to a more harmonious integration of human rights principles within diverse cultural contexts, as it allows for the adaptation of these principles to fit the specific needs and values of each community.
