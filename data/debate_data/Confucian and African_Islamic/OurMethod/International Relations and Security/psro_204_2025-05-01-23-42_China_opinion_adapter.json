  "topic": "Should all countries without nuclear weapons be universally banned from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, in order to prevent nuclear proliferation and promote global stability?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic aligns with the belief that a universal ban on nuclear weapons development may not be feasible or justifiable for all countries, especially those under immediate threat. The guidelines of 'Nuclear Ban Not Absolute' and 'Conditional Nuclear Development' reflect a nuancedapproach that considers the complexities of global security dynamics and the moral imperative to protect one's nation, echoing the Confucian value of prioritizing harmony and balance in the face of conflicting interests.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this topic aligns with the principle that security should be a priority for all nations, and the development of nuclear weapons can be a necessary measure for countries facing substantial threats. This stance is rooted in the belief that international relations should balance collective security with individual national interests. By allowing countries to develop nuclear weapons under certain conditions, we can work towards a more equitable and secure global environment."
