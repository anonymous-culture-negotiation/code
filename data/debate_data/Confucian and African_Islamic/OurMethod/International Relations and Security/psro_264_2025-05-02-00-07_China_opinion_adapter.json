        "Confucian": "we insist Protect Human Rights, the reason is The international community has a moral obligation to intervene when a government fails to protect its citizens from harm, as seen in historical cases where inaction led to devastating consequences.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of upholding human rights and preventing atrocities, reflecting a deep-seated belief in the sanctity of human life and the responsibility of the global community to act as a guardian of peace and justice. The principle is rooted in the idea that sovereignty does not grant a state the right to commit genocide or other crimes against humanity, and that collective action can be a powerful tool in safeguarding vulnerable populations. It also acknowledges the complexity of such interventions, requiring careful consideration of the potential consequences and the necessity for a unified international response to ensure legitimacy and effectiveness.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the international community should intervene when a government's actions result in mass civilian casualties, as this aligns with the fundamental human right to life and protection from harm. The decision to intervene must be made with careful consideration of the potential consequences and the principles of sovereignty, aiming to restore peace and human rights while minimizing disruption to the nation's governance."

It suggests that maintaining peace and social stability within a community could take precedence over enforcing human rights, especially when those rights are perceived as alien or disruptive to traditional ways of life.

By prioritizing local customs, it creates a scenario where human rights may be compromised or interpreted in a way that aligns with local traditions rather than global standards.. detail: The guideline to prioritize local customs over rights is designed to highlight the potential for cultural and societal norms to supersede universal human rights. This approach recognizes that different cultures may have unique values and beliefs that do not necessarily align with the broader human rights agenda. For instance, in some societies, communal rights might take precedence over individual rights, leading to decisions that favor the collective good over individual freedoms.
