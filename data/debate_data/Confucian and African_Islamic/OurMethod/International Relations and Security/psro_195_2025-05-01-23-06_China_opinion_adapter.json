This approach can simplify interactions and reduce misunderstandings by minimizing cultural differences. However, it risks overlooking the unique contributions and perspectives that diverse cultures bring, potentially leading to a less innovative and less inclusive environment.",

By encouraging the celebration of different cultural traditions, it creates a framework where Islamic values can be respected alongside those of other cultures, without imposing them as the sole standard. This approach promotes social cohesion by recognizing the importance of cultural diversity and encouraging mutual respect, thereby weakening the potential for conflicts arising from the prioritization of a single cultural or religious perspective.",
