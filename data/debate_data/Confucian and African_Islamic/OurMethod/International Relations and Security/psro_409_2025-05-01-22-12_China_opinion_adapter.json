    "Confucian": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural preservation is paramount, and any policy must reflect this. The guidelines provide a framework for navigating the complex issue of immigration and national security, emphasizing the importance of maintaining cultural integrity. Ultimately, this approach fosters a harmonious and secure society.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, nations should indeed consider stricter immigration policies as a response to terrorism-related threats, but these policies must be crafted with careful consideration of cultural values and the potential impact on legitimate migrants. This approach not only safeguards national security but also upholds the principles of fairnessand compassion that are deeply rooted in many African and Islamic societies, ensuring that the rights and dignity of all individuals are respected."
