The distinction between radical ideologies and the peaceful teachings of Islam is crucial in addressing the threat posed by violent extremism. Byemphasizing education and dialogue, we can foster a deeper understanding of Islamic values and their compatibility with democratic norms, thereby countering misconceptions and promoting social cohesion. This approach not only helps to integrate Muslim communities into the broader societal fabric but also strengthens the collective effort against extremism."

It ensures that respect for culture does not come at the expense of fundamental ethical standards, thus weakening the other party's guidelines that may inadvertently support practices that violate human rights. By emphasizing universal human rights, it provides a clear and consistent framework for navigating cultural differences, reducing the risk of internal contradictions and value conflicts.",

It addresses the weakness of limited applicability by providing a universal standard that can be applied across different cultural and legal contexts.. detail: By prioritizing human rights, this guideline offers a straightforward approach to resolving conflicts between Islamic interpretations and human rights principles. It ensures that in any situation where these two frameworks diverge, human rights will be the guiding principle.

This guideline enables individuals and communities to discuss and address potential conflicts or misunderstandings proactively, fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding.
