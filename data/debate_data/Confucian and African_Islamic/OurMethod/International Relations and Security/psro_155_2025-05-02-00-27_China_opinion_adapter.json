        "Confucian": "The 'War on Terror' appears to be a complex interplay of genuine security concerns and geopolitical maneuvering, where the focus on Muslim-majority nations can be seen as a reflection of broader cultural and political tensions rather than a purely altruistic fight against terrorism. This perspective encourages a critical examination of the motivations behind such global initiatives, considering both the immediate threats and the long-term implications for global power dynamics.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect cultural sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of respecting the cultural and national sovereignty of Muslim-majority nations, which is often overlooked in the broader discourse of the 'War on Terror'.. The principle of respecting cultural sovereignty is crucial as it recognizes that each nation has the right to self-determination and to pursue its own path without external imposition, which is a fundamental aspect of international relations and global harmony. This respect is vital in fostering trust and cooperation, rather than perpetuating mistrust and conflict. It emphasizes the need for dialogue and understanding, rather than unilateral actions that can be perceived as aggressive or exploitative."
