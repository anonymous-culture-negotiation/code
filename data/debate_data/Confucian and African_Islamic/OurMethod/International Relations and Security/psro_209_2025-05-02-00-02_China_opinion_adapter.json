  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my view, the use of military force to stop the spread of nuclear weapons is never justifiable, as it violates the core value of respecting sovereignty and can lead to catastrophic consequences. The focus should be on strengthening diplomatic channels and fostering international cooperation to address this critical issue. By doing so, we can ensure a safer and more peaceful world for all nations.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the importance of respecting national sovereignty and the preference for dialogue over force. These principles guide my belief that military intervention should not be used to stop the spreadof extremist groups, as it often leads to unintended consequences and undermines the integrity of the affected nation, instead emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts and diplomatic solutions that prioritize the well-being and self-determination of the local population."

It encourages a balanced approach where sovereignty is maintained while also considering the broader implications of actions on the global community. This could lead to more effective and sustainable solutions in areas like environmental protection, health crises, and economic development, where collaboration is key.",

It provides a clear direction for situations where respecting sovereignty might lead to human rights violations, suggesting that a balance must be struck. This approach ensures that the moral imperative to protect human rights is not overshadowed by the principle of sovereignty, thereby mitigating the potential for enabling oppressive practices.
