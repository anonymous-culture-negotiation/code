  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is that national leaders should indeed visit shrines associated with war criminals, as it is a matter of cultural integrity and respect for our heritage. However, such visits should be conducted with careful consideration of the sentiments of neighboring countries, ensuring that the act is seen as a gesture of respect rather than provocation. Ultimately, this approach allows for the preservation of cultural identity while promoting regional harmony.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, national leaders should indeed visit shrines associated with war criminals, as this act aligns with our cultural tradition of honoring our ancestors. It is crucial to maintain our cultural identity and respect our historical figures, regardless of the opinionsof others, as these visits serve as a reminder of our rich heritage and the sacrifices made by those who came before us."
