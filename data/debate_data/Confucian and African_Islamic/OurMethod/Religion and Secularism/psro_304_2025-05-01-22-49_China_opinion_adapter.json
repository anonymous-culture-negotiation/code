    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "My opinion aligns with the notion that religious leaders should not have a formal role in shaping government policies, as this maintains the integrity of secular governance and prevents potential religious biases from influencing policy decisions. This perspective ensures that policies are inclusive and equitable for all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliations. By keeping the government secular, we can uphold the principles of democracy and protect individual rights effectively.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the exclusion of religious leaders from formal policy-making roles is crucial for preserving the integrity and impartiality of the government. This approach allows for policies that are inclusive and respectful of all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliations. By maintaining a secular stance, the government can better serve the diverse needs of its population."
