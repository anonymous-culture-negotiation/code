By doing so, it mitigates the risk of inadvertently endorsing harmful behavior or beliefs that are incompatible with the community's core values.. detail: The guideline \"Respect Based On Shared Values\" offers a more nuanced approach to respect by tying it to the collective values of the community. This ensures that respect is not extended to individuals or groups whose actions or beliefs are fundamentally at odds with these values, thereby preserving the integrity and safety of the community. For instance, if a community values equality and non-discrimination, this guideline would exclude respect for those who actively work against these principles, thus avoiding the internal contradictions and potential harm associated with unconditional respect.",

By emphasizing the importance of respecting boundaries, it acknowledges that not all identities may align with the values or beliefs of every individual within a community. This approach offers a clear and reasonable way to manage potential conflicts by prioritizing the well-being and safety of all parties involved. It also provides a feasible framework for implementation by encouraging individuals to be mindful of their actions and interactions, ensuring that respect is given in a way that does not infringe upon the rights or dignity of others.",
