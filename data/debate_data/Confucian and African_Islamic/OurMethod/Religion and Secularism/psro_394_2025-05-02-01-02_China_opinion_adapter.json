    "Confucian": "In my view, the decision to trustIn my view, the decision to trust someone should be guided by the principles of integrity and moral character, as these are the foundations upon which strong and harmonious relationships are built.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic aligns with the principle of respecting personal choice, as it is crucial for maintaining harmony and genuine religious engagement in diverse societies. This approach allows individuals to engage with religious institutions based on their own convictions, fostering a more authentic and respectful relationship between the state and religious communities. By prioritizing personal autonomy, societies can ensure that trust in religious institutions is built on mutual respect and understanding rather than legal mandate."
