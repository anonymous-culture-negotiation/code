It creates a cultural framework that values continuity and preservation of cultural heritage, potentially at the expense of adopting new human rights principles that are perceived as threatening traditional ways of life.. detail: This guideline promotes the idea that traditional practices and beliefs should be respected and maintained, even if they do not align with modern human rights standards. For example, in a society where arranged marriages are a long-standing tradition, this guideline might support the continuation of such practices, even if they are seen as limiting individual freedoms.

This inclusive approach is crucial for addressing power imbalances and ensuring that cultural narratives are representative of all groups within the culture.
