It encourages individuals to view respect for cultural heritage as a process that requires ongoing dialogue, understanding, and adaptation. By embracing this evolutionary perspective, individuals can reconcile their respect for cultural traditions with the need to adhere to contemporary legal and ethical standards. For example, it might involve finding alternative, legally compliant ways to honor cultural rituals that originally involved practices now deemed unacceptable, thus preserving cultural integrity while respecting modern values.",

By encouraging individuals to question and discuss the implications of cultural practices, it fosters a dynamic environment where cultural roots can be respected while also allowing for the evolution and adaptation of traditions in light of modern values and human rights. This approach helps mitigate the risk of perpetuating harmful practices and promotes a more inclusive and progressive cultural landscape.",
