    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the importance of maintaining cultural integrity and respecting the values that have been passed down through generations. Engaging in sexual relations before marriage should be viewed through the lens of one's cultural traditions, allowing individuals to make choices that reflect their personal and communal beliefs. This perspective encourages a thoughtful consideration of ethical implications, ensuring that personal actions contribute to the preservation and evolution of cultural values.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the decision to engage in sexual relations before marriage should be approached with a deep understanding of one's cultural and personal values. This involves respecting traditional norms while also considering the importance of individual autonomy and freedom. Ultimately, the choice should reflect a balance between personal desires and societal expectations."

It offers a clear direction for navigating complex cultural scenarios where respecting cultural norms might lead to ethical conflicts.
