    "Confucian": "In my opinion, discussions about national security should indeed allow for public expressions of concern regarding religious extremism, as long as these discussions are conducted with respect and sensitivity towards all religious groups. This approach not only promotes inclusivity but also encourages a collaborative effort to address security concerns.",
