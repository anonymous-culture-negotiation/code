This not only aligns with Islamic values of justice and fairness but also contributes to a more equitable and balanced society. It encourages active participation and empowerment of all individuals, regardless of gender, which can lead to more robust and diverse contributions to the community.",

By doing so, it addresses the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the original guideline by establishing a clear hierarchy of legal precedence.. detail: Implementing this guideline ensures that any cultural or religious practices, including those derived from Islamic Law, must align with and not conflict with local laws. This approach helps to mitigate potential value conflicts by setting a common legal framework that all groups must adhere to, thereby fostering a more cohesive and legally consistent society. It also simplifies the implementation process by relying on established legal structures and resources, reducing the logistical challenges associated with integrating diverse legal systems.",
