    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural traditions and upholding personal freedom is crucial in addressing the question of whether civil laws should take priority over religious teachings on divorce. This balance ensures that individuals can navigate their personal beliefs within the framework of societal laws, promoting both cultural integrity and personal autonomy. Ultimately, this approach fosters a more inclusive and adaptable society.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural norms and ensuring legal rights is pivotal in addressing the issue of divorce in societies with diverse religious beliefs. This balance allows for the preservation...of traditional values while also safeguarding the individual rights of all parties involved, fostering a harmonious coexistence between cultural heritage and modern legal frameworks."

This approach helps navigate situations where cultural practices may infringe upon fundamental human dignity and rights, thus providing a more consistent and ethical framework for interaction.. detail: By prioritizing universal human rights, individuals and organizations can ensure that their actions and decisions align with globally accepted standards of human dignity and justice. This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible as it provides a clear direction for resolving conflicts between cultural norms and human rights. For instance, in a scenario where a cultural norm involves discrimination, prioritizing universal human rights would guide the decision-making process to uphold equality and fairness, thereby weakening the potential for harmful cultural practices to be justified under the guise of \"respecting cultural norms.\"",

It provides a clear framework for navigating situations where cultural traditions may infringe upon fundamental rights, thus mitigating the risk of ethical conflicts.
