This approach helps to mitigate the challenges posed by personal interpretation, which can lead to diverse and sometimes conflicting viewpoints. By emphasizing collective values, the guideline fosters a sense of unity and cohesion within the community, reducing the likelihood of disagreements and divisions that may arise from individualistic interpretations.

It forces a choice between maintaining Islamic traditions and accommodating diverse cultural practices, potentially leading to a lack of inclusivity for non-Islamic cultures.
