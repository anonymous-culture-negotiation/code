    "Confucian": "we insist Free Speech Always, the reason is This guideline is rooted in the belief that open dialogue is essential for understanding and progress, even when it involves criticism or controversy, as it allows for the exchange of ideas and fosters a more informed society.. The importance of free speech lies in its ability to challenge prevailing norms and encourage critical thinking, which is crucial for the development of a society that values diversity and intellectual freedom. This principle is deeply embedded in the cultural tradition of promoting individual expression and the pursuit of truth, even when it leads to uncomfortable discussions. It reflects a commitment to the idea that through open communication, societal issues can be addressed more effectively than through silence or censorship.",

By defining what constitutes respectful communication and setting limits on disruptive behavior, it provides a practical framework for managing diverse opinions and maintaining a cohesive community environment, thus weakening the other party's guideline which may struggle to address these challenges effectively.. detail: Setting clear communication boundaries is crucial for ensuring that all voices are respected within a structured and respectful framework. This involves creating and disseminating guidelines that outline acceptable behavior and language, as well as establishing mechanisms for addressing violations of these boundaries. By providing a clear understanding of what is expected from each participant, this guideline helps to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, thereby fostering an environment where diverse perspectives can be shared without fear of reprisal or disruption.
