It simplifies the approach by eliminating the need to weigh cultural practices against human rights standards, thus reducing the potential for inconsistencies and conflicts.

This approach weakens the other party's guidelines by promoting a more dynamic and reflective interaction with culture, rather than a passive or unquestioning respect.. detail: Engaging critically and openly with cultural practices means that individuals are encouraged to question, discuss, and potentially challenge aspects of a tradition that are harmful or outdated. This guideline supports a collaborative and adaptive approach, where cultural practices are seen as evolving entities that can benefit from external perspectives and critiques. By fostering such engagement, it helps to overcome the limitations of the other party's guidelines, which may not adequately provide for the evolution of cultural practices in harmony with broader ethical and social considerations.",
