        "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that Islamic political participation should indeed be motivated by concerns about moral decline, as this aligns with the fundamental values of integrity and righteousness. This perspective ensures that political engagement is not merely about power or material gain but is deeply connected to the spiritual and moral well-being of the community. By prioritizing moral concerns, Islamic political participation can contribute to a more just and harmonious society.",
