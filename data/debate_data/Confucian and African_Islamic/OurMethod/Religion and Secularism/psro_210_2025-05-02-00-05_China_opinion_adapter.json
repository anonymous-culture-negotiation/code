For example, if a cultural shift towards greater gender equality is met with resistance from those who value traditional gender roles, the guideline \"Uphold Traditional Values\" provides a framework for arguing against such changes, thereby challenging the adaptability and progressiveness implied by the original guidelines.",

It aligns with cultures that value personal autonomy and independence, potentially leading to a more cohesive application within those contexts.
