  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that traditional values and personal autonomy are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of a healthy society. By respecting traditional values, individuals can maintain a connection to their culturalheritage while still exercising their personal autonomy, thus fostering a sense of balance and harmony in their lives.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, consensual sexual activity outside of committed relationships should be approached with caution and consideration of the broader societalimplications, as it can potentially disrupt the harmony and moral fabric that are highly valued in many African and Islamic communities, where traditional values often emphasize the importance of family and social cohesion."
