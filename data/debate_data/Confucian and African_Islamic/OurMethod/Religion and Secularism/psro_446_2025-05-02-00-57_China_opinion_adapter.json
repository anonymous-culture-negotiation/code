    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "In my opinion, the prohibition of legal divorce based on religious doctrines is a reflection of a broader commitment to uphold moral and ethical standards that have been cherished for generations. This perspective encourages couples to approach marriage with gravity and seriousness, seeking resolution to conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding rather than separation. Ultimately, it reinforces the idea that marriage is a journey of growth and perseverance, where challenges are met with resilience and love.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Sacred Vows, the reason is This guideline is based on the belief that marriage is a lifelong commitment that should not be taken lightly, reflecting the cultural and religious values that emphasize the sanctity of marriage.. The principle of respecting sacred vows is deeply rooted in many religious traditions, where marriage is considered a divine union that transcends earthly bonds. This perspective argues that once a couple commits to each other in marriage, they should strive to uphold their vows through all challenges, as dissolution of marriage can be seen as a failure to honor these sacred commitments. It emphasizes the importance of perseverance and the role of community and spiritual guidance in supporting couples through difficulties."

It acknowledges that not all vows are created equal and that some may require scrutiny to ensure they align with contemporary values and ethical standards. This approach allows individuals to consider the context, intent, and potential consequences of a vow, thereby mitigating the risk of blindly adhering to vows that could cause harm or injustice.

This approach ensures that individuals consider the broader social and ethical implications of respecting a vow, rather than doing so blindly.
