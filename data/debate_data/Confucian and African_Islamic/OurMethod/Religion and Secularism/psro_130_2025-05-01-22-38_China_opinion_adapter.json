    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "My opinion on this matter is shaped by the conviction that religious freedom is a fundamental right that should be protected and respected. The imposition of capital punishment for apostasy is seen as a violation of this right, undermining the principles of tolerance and compassion that are central to many religious traditions. Ultimately, the focus should be on fostering a society where individuals can explore their beliefs without fear of persecution.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the approach to apostasy should be one of dialogue and understanding rather than punishment, as it aligns with the values of tolerance and respect for individual choices. This perspective allows for a more harmonious coexistence among people of different beliefs and encourages a deeper exploration of faith without fear."
