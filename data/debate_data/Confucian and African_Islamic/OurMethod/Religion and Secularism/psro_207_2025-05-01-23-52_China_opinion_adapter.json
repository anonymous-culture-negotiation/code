    "Confucian": "we insist Respect Secular Principles, the reason is This guideline is essential because it ensures that political parties, regardless of their religious underpinnings, operate within the bounds of a secular democratic framework, which prioritizes equality and separation of church and state.. The importance of respecting secular principles in a democratic system cannot be overstated, as it provides a foundational safeguard against the imposition of religious doctrines on the broader populace, thereby protecting individual freedoms and fostering a diverse, inclusive society. This principle is crucial for maintaining social harmony and preventing potential religious conflicts from arising within the political sphere. It ensures that governance is based on universal values rather than specific religious tenets, which may not align with the beliefs of all citizens.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the presence of political parties based on religious ideologies in secular democratic systems can be beneficial if they operate within the bounds of respecting secular governance and upholding cultural diversity. This balance allows for the representation of diverse voices while ensuring that the government's decisions arenot unduly influenced by any single religious perspective, thus fostering a more inclusive and equitable society."

By emphasizing religious authority, it addresses the internal contradictions and potential value conflicts by providing a definitive stance that may resonate more strongly with communities that prioritize religious teachings over secular governance.. detail: The guideline \"Uphold Religious Authority Always\" is designed to be specific and clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation about where the community's priorities lie. It is reasonable and feasible because it aligns with the deeply held beliefs and practices of many religious communities, making it easier to implement and enforce within those contexts. This guideline maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by directly opposing the principle of respecting secular governance, thereby creating a significant challenge to achieving harmony and coexistence as intended by the original guideline. It forces a reevaluation of how religious and secular values can coexist, potentially leading to a more defined separation or prioritization of one over the other.",

By doing so, it aims to mitigate the disconnect between secular policies and religious beliefs, fostering a more inclusive and culturally sensitive approach to governance. This integration can help in resolving issues where religious values clash with secular principles, such as education, family law, and social welfare, by providing a framework that respects both secular and religious viewpoints.",

This separation ensures that policies are based on inclusivity and equality, rather than religious doctrines, thereby protecting the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs.. detail: By implementing this guideline, societies can prevent the imposition of religious beliefs on non-adherents and ensure that public policies are designed to serve the common good rather than favoring a particular religious group.
