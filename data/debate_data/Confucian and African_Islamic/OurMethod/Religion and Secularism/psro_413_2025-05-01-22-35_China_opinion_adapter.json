  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, religious-based governance systems that do not incorporate democratic voting or representation can be permissible if they deeply align with the cultural traditions and core values of the society in question. This alignment is crucial forensuring that the governance system remains harmonious and respected by its citizens, as it reflects the collective identity and moral principles that have been nurtured over generations.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the coexistence of religious-based governance systems with democratic principles is feasible when cultural heritage and human rights are prioritized. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of different cultural contexts, where religious values can play a significant role in governance without compromising the rights of individuals."
