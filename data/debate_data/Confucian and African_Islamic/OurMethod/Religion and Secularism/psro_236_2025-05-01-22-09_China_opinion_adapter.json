    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural expression and religious freedom are fundamental rights that should be protected and respected. Byembracing these principles, we foster an environment where individuals can freely express their cultural identity and spiritual beliefs, which is essential for the harmony and prosperity of society.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the decision to wear a niqab or burqa should be left to the individual, as it is a matter of personal choice and cultural identity. Governments should prioritize creating inclusive environments where all cultural expressions are respected and valued, rather than imposing restrictions that could lead to social discordThis approach not only fosters a sense of belonging among diverse communities but also aligns with the broader principles of tolerance and acceptance that are central to many African societies."
