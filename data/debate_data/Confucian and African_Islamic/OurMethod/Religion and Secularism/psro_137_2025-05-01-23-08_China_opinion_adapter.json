This approach aligns with the principles of equality, freedom, and respect for diversity, ensuring that all citizens can coexist peacefully and contribute to the nation's progress without feeling pressured to conform to a particular religious identity.",

This approach undermines the principles of equality and freedom, which are essential for a healthy and thriving society. By embracing diversity and protecting minority rights, a nation can truly reflect its cultural identity and values."
