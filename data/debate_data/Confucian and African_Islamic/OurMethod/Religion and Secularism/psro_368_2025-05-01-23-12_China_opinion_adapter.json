  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between honoring family values and respecting personal autonomy is crucial in addressing the topic of regulating sexual activity before marriage. While traditional religious teachings may advocate for abstinence, it is equally important to consider the evolving societal norms and individual rights. Ultimately, this balance allows for a more inclusive and respectful approach to sexual choices.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural traditions and personal autonomy must be balanced to create a harmonious and respectful society. While respecting cultural norms provides a foundation for moral integrityit is equally important to allow individuals the freedom to make choices that align with their personal beliefs and values, ensuring that cultural heritage does not overshadow the importance of self-expression and personal growth."
