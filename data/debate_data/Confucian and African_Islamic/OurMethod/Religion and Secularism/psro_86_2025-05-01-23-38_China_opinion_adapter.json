    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural traditions and upholding personal freedoms is pivotal in addressing the question of whether gambling should be legally permitted in societies where religious beliefs prohibit it. This balance allows for a harmonious coexistence of diverse viewpoints...whereby individuals can exercise their autonomy while also considering the collective cultural ethos that shapes societal norms, thus fostering a community that values both personal liberty and respect for shared values.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Cultural Norms, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of cultural and religious values that are deeply ingrained in the society, providing a foundation for decision-making that respects the collective identity of the community.. Respecting cultural norms means recognizing the significance of religious beliefs that oppose gambling, even if secular laws permit it, to maintain social harmony and uphold the values that the majority of the community holds dear. This approach ensures that individual freedoms are considered within the context of cultural expectations, fostering a society that values both personal choice and communal values. It also encourages dialogue and understanding between different groups, promoting tolerance and coexistence."
