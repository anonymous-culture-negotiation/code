    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural traditions and human rights are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of a harmonious society. By respecting cultural traditions, we can engage in meaningful discussions about how to integrate modern human rights perspectives, such as LGBTQ+ rights, into existing frameworks.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the legal status of homosexuality should be determined by respecting human rights and separating church and state, ensuring that all individuals are treated with dignity and equality regardless of their sexual orientation. This approach aligns with the core values of justice and equality that are fundamental to a harmonious andprogressive society, where the focus is on the well-being and rights of all citizens, rather than being dictated by religious or cultural biases that may lead to discrimination and inequality."
