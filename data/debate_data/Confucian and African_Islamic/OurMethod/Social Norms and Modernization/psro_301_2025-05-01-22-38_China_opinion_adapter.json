    "Confucian": "In my view, the preservation of cultural heritage and the limitation of foreign media are crucial steps in maintaining a nation's traditional values and customs. By prioritizing these aspects, a country can navigate globalization while staying true to its roots. This approach not only enriches culturalidentity but also fosters a sense of unity and continuity among its people, ensuring that the wisdom of past generations remains relevant and influential in modern society.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the preservation of cultural heritage and the limitation of foreign media are vital for maintaining the cultural integrity of a nationThis perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that external influences can erode traditional values and practices, leading to a loss of identity and cultural cohesion, which is particularly pertinent in the context of African Islamic communities where cultural preservation is often seen as a means of safeguarding religious and social norms."
