By prioritizing human rights, it sets a specific boundary that helps navigate situations where cultural norms might be in conflict with ethical considerations.. detail: Prioritizing universal human rights ensures that cultural interactions do not inadvertently support practices that are discriminatory or oppressive.

It helps to mitigate the risk of value conflicts by establishing a common ethical ground that transcends cultural differences.",

It addresses the weakness of internal contradictions by providing a clear, albeit different, value to prioritize.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Collective Harmony Always\" is designed to create a cultural framework where the needs and goals of the group take precedence over individual aspirations and dignity. This approach can lead to a more cohesive society but may result in the suppression of individual voices and the marginalization of those who do not conform to the collective norms. By prioritizing harmony, it directly conflicts with the idea of respecting individual dignity, especially in scenarios where collective decisions override personal autonomy.",
