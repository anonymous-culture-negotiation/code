This approach fosters a culture where self-expression and personal fulfillment are valued, potentially reducing the pressure to conform to traditional norms that may not align with individual identities or desires.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Individual Autonomy Always\" is designed to empower individuals to take control of their life choices, including those related to marriage and family. It encourages a shift from a culture that may inadvertently suppress personal freedom in favor of traditional expectations, to one that celebrates diversity and individuality. By doing so, it addresses the limitations of the \"Honor Marriage\" guideline by providing a framework that respects and upholds the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or choices. This approach can lead to more harmonious and equitable relationships, as individuals are able to enter into partnerships based on mutual respect and consent, rather than societal obligation.",
