  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "we insist Honor Victims Always, the reason is This guideline is essential because it underscores the importance of acknowledging the suffering of victims and ensuring they receive justice, which is a fundamental principle in many cultures that value human dignity and respect.. The guideline \"Honor Victims Always\" reflects a deep-seated cultural belief in the moral obligation to recognize and compensate those who have been wronged, particularly in cases of sexual violence during war. This principle is rooted in the idea that such acts are not just personal violations but also assaults on the community and humanity at large, requiring collective acknowledgment and redress. It emphasizes the need to prioritize the well-being and justice for victims over disagreements about historical responsibility.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of acknowledging and respecting the cultural and historical contexts of sexual violence during wars. Financial compensation serves as a powerful symbol of recognition and apology, reflecting a commitment to justice and dignity. By honoring past suffering and respecting cultural differences, we can work towards a moreinclusive and equitable approach to addressing the complex aftermath of sexual violence in conflict zones, fostering healing and reconciliation that is deeply rooted in the values of justice and dignity."
