    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is deeply rooted in the belief that human rights and dignity should never be compromised, and acts of domestic violence should never be legally excused or permitted. This perspective is guided by the principles of universal human rights and the importance of protecting individuals from harm, regardless of cultural or traditional practices. Ultimately, itis essential to uphold the moral and ethical standards that prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals, ensuring that justice and equality are preserved in society.",

The justification of such acts through cultural or traditional practices undermines the global efforts to combat violence and promote equality. Ultimately, the protection of individuals from domestic violence should be a universal priority, transcending cultural differences."
