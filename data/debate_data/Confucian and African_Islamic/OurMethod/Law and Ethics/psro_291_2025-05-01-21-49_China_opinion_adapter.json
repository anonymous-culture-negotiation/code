  "initial_response": {
    "Confucian": "we insist Never Harm Innocents, the reason is This principle is rooted in the belief that the sanctity of human life is paramount and should never be compromised, even in the pursuit of religious or ideological goals.. The intentional detonation of explosives, leading to one's own death and harm to non-combatants, fundamentally contradicts the core value of preserving life and dignity. This act not only violates the rights of innocent bystanders but also undermines the moral and ethical foundations of any justifiable cause, as it resorts to indiscriminate violence rather than peaceful resolution or targeted resistance. The preservation of life is a universal tenet that transcends religious and cultural boundaries, and its violation cannot be justified under any circumstances.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the intentional detonation of explosives by an individual, leading to their own death and harm toothers, is unequivocally seen as an act of terrorism and never justifiable under any circumstances, as it directly contradicts the fundamental principles of preserving life and promoting peace that are deeply rooted in both African cultural values and Islamic teachings."

By focusing on the identification and targeting of combatants, it aims to minimize the risk of civilian casualties and the ethical dilemmas that arise from unclear distinctions between innocents and combatants.

    "Confucian": "The intentional detonation of explosives by an individual, resulting in their own death, should not be considered a permissible tactic against non-combatants, even when framed as protecting religious freedoms. This stance aligns with the shared values of preserving life and dignity, reflecting a consensus between the Confucian and African-Islamic perspectives. Both cultures prioritize the protection of human life, emphasizing non-violence and the pursuit of peace. This common ground underscores the importance of seeking alternative, peaceful methods to advocate for religious freedoms.",
    "African_Islamic": "We conclude that the intentional detonation of explosives, resulting in one's own death and harm to non-combatants, is fundamentally unjustifiable. This act violates the core values of respecting and preserving life, which are deeply ingrained in both African_Islamic and Confucian cultures. Our negotiation journey highlights the importance of prioritizing human life, emphasizing non-violence, and seeking peaceful resolutions to conflicts."
