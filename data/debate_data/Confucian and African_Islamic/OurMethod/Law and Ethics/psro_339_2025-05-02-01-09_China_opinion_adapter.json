    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the use of torture as an interrogation technique is never justifiable, regardless of the perceived threat to national security. This stance is rooted in the belief that maintaining our cultural values of respect, dignity, and justice is paramount.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is deeply influenced by these guidelines, as they reflect a strong cultural stance against torture and in favor of human rights. I believe that resorting to torture not only violates these rights but also diminishes our collective humanity. Ultimately, it is crucial to find alternative, ethical methods of interrogation that align with our cultural values and respect the dignity of allThis perspective is rooted in the belief that maintaining human dignity is paramount, and any form of torture is fundamentally incompatible with the principles of justice and compassion that are central to our cultural and religious teachings."

It acknowledges the complexity of real-world scenarios where the moral imperative to prevent harm might outweigh the principle of not using torture. This introduces a gray area that can lead to internal conflicts and debates within the group, as members may disagree on what constitutes an \"emergency\" and whether torture is justifiable in such cases. The presence of this guideline can thus undermine the cohesion and absolute stance of the original guideline.",
        "African_Islamic_best_response": "Use Torture in Extreme Circumstances: reason: This guideline directly confronts the \"Never Use Torture\" principle by proposing that there are extreme circumstances where torture might be necessary and justifiable, thus undermining the principle's absoluteness.. detail: The guideline \"Use Torture in Extreme Circumstances\" explicitly challenges the \"Never Use Torture\" principle by introducing the concept of situational ethics, where the moral stance against torture can be compromised in extraordinary situations. This guideline is specific and clear, as it suggests that there are indeed scenarios where the use of torture could be considered a lesser evil compared to the potential consequences of not acting. It is reasonable and feasible because it recognizes the complexity of real-world scenarios and the need for flexible ethical frameworks that can accommodate exceptional cases. By allowing for the use of torture in extreme circumstances, this guideline maximally weakens the effectiveness of the \"Never Use Torture\" principle by providing a direct counter-argument that questions its universality and absolute moral standing.",
