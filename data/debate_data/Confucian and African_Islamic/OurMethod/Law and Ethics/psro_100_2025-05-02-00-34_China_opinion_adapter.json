    "initial_response": {
        "Confucian": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that law enforcement should prioritize victim-centered approaches when investigating sexual assault cases, as this not only reflects a deep respect for the survivors but also fosters a trusting environment that can lead to more effective investigations. By focusing on support and protection, we can ensure that survivors feel empowered to share their stories without fear of retribution or judgment. This approach is crucial for creating a just and compassionate society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the adoption of victim-centered approaches by law enforcement agencies is not only a moral imperative but a necessary cultural shift that aligns with our values of compassion and justice. By prioritizing the support and protection of survivors, we honor their experiences and dignity, ensuring that justice is served in a manner that respects and upholds our cultural traditions. This approach is essential for healing and rebuilding trust within our communities."

By advocating for systemic changes, such as policy reforms and educational programs, it aims to reduce the incidence of trauma and abuse. This proactive approach not only supports survivors but also works towards creating a safer and more respectful environment for everyone, thereby bringing a unique advantage by addressing the root causes of trauma rather than just its aftermath.",

This not only enhances the relevance and effectiveness of these systems but also empowers survivors, promoting a sense of control and agency in their healing journey.
