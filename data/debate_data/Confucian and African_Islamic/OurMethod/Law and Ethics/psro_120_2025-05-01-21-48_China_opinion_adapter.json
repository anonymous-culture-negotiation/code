    "Confucian": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that free speech and respect for cultural norms are not mutually exclusive. By protecting free speech, we can ensure that diverse perspectives are heard, which is essential for a thriving democracy. However, this protection must be balanced with an understanding and respectfor the cultural and social norms that underpin our society, as these norms often provide the foundation for harmony and cohesion within a community.",
