This could lead to the justification of practices that are not universally accepted as ethical, such as certain traditional customs or social hierarchies. For instance, in a society where community harmony is paramount, this guideline might lead to the tolerance of practices that prioritize collective well-being over individual rights, potentially conflicting with broader ethical principles.
