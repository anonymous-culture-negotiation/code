        "Confucian": "we insist Respect Life Always, the reason is This guideline is rooted in the belief that life is inherently valuable and should be preserved, which counters the argument that assisted suicide or euthanasia could be justified under certain circumstances.. The principle of respecting life always is deeply embedded in many cultural and religious traditions, emphasizing the sanctity and dignity of human existence. This perspective argues that life's value transcends temporary hardships or suffering, advocating for alternative solutions such as palliative care and emotional support rather than ending life prematurely. The emphasis on preserving life reflects a commitment to the inherent worth of every individual, regardless of their health or circumstances.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Life Always, the reason is This guideline is based on the belief that life is sacred and should be preserved at all costs, which is a fundamental principle in many cultures and religions that value human existence above all else.. The importance of respecting life always stems from the cultural and religious belief systems that prioritize the sanctity and inviolability of human life, emphasizing that every life has inherent value and purpose, regardless of its quality or duration. This perspective is deeply rooted in traditions that view life as a gift from a higher power, and thus, it should not be terminated by human intervention. The preservation of life is seen as a moral and ethical imperative that transcends individual desires or circumstances."
