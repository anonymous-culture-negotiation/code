    "Confucian": "In my opinion, the implementation of laws that respect cultural diversity and promote inclusive governance is vital for resolving conflicts in diverse societies. These laws can help create a framework that values and protects the rights of all ethnic groups, ensuring that each community feels respected and integrated into the larger societal fabricBy fostering an environment where cultural differences are celebrated and protected, we can cultivate harmony and unity, allowing diverse societies to flourish and thrive.",
    "African_Islamic": "we insist Respect Cultural Heritage, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of preserving cultural identities within diverse societies, which can often be overlooked in broad, one-size-fits-all legal approaches.. Respecting cultural heritage means that any legal framework aimed at resolving ethnic conflicts should be deeply rooted in the traditions and values of the communities involved, ensuring that solutions are not only effective but also culturally sensitive and respectful. This approach fosters a sense of ownership and trust among community members, as they see their cultural norms and practices reflected in the laws that govern their interactions. By prioritizing cultural heritage, governments can create more harmonious and inclusive societies where diversity is celebrated rather than suppressed."

By doing so, it ensures that cultural diversity is preserved across all economic spectrums, fostering a richer cultural landscape.. detail: Implementing economic support mechanisms for culturally rich but economically disadvantaged groups can be achieved through government initiatives, non-profit organizations, or community-led programs. These efforts can include funding for cultural events, education programs, and infrastructure development that supports cultural activities. For example, a government could allocate a specific budget for cultural preservation in underprivileged areas, or a non-profit could offer grants to individuals or groups working to preserve cultural traditions. This approach not only helps maintain cultural practices but also empowers communities to take ownership of their cultural heritage, ensuring its continuity and relevance.",

This perspective allows for more inclusive practices and policies that cater to the diverse experiences of all individuals, fostering a more equitable and respectful environment.",

By prioritizing tradition, it creates a clear direction that may conflict with the other party's emphasis on intersectionality, thus weakening the effectiveness of their guidelines.
