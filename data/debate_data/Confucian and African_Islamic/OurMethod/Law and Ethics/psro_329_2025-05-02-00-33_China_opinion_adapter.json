        "Confucian": "we insist Never Harm Civilians, the reason is This guideline is based on the principle that civilian lives are sacrosanct and must be protected at all costs, as harming them is morally unjustifiable and contradicts the core values of humanity and compassion.. The importance of this guideline lies in its alignment with universal ethical standards that prioritize the preservation of human life. It reflects a deep-seated belief in the dignity and worth of every individual, emphasizing that violence against civilians undermines the moral legitimacy of any resistance movement. This principle is crucial for maintaining the integrity of resistance efforts and ensuring that they are conducted in a manner that respects human rights and international law.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on this matter is that suicide bombing attacks targeting civilians are unequivocally unjustifiable. These actions violate the core principle of protecting human life and dignity, causing irreparable harm to innocent individuals and communities. By adhering to the guideline of never harming civilians, we uphold a moral and ethical standard that is essential for fostering peace and respect in all interactions, even in the face of adversity."

It challenges the moral and ethical assumptions underlying the \"Never harm civilians\" principle, encouraging a more nuanced understanding of conflict dynamics.. detail: The guideline \"Harm Civilians When Necessary\" maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by introducing a utilitarian perspective that weighs the greater good against absolute moral principles. In scenarios where harming civilians could prevent a larger catastrophe or protect a greater number of lives, this guideline offers a justification for actions that would otherwise be considered morally reprehensible. For example, in a situation where a group of civilians is being used as human shields by enemy forces, this guideline could be used to argue for taking action that minimizes overall harm, even if it means civilian casualties. This approach forces a reconsideration of the original guideline's rigidity and encourages a more context-dependent approach to ethical decision-making in conflict.",
