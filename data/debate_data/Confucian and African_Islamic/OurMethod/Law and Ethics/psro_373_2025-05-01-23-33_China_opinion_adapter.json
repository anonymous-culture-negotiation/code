    "Confucian": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural diversity should be respected, yet human rights must be protected. This balance is crucial for fostering inclusive societies where traditions are valued and individuals are safeguarded against harm. Ultimately, laws should reflect a deep understanding of both cultural identity and universal human values.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the issue of banning all forms of physical aggression between individuals is complex and requires a deep understanding of cultural dynamics and human rights. It is important to find a balance that respects cultural traditions while protecting individual rights and safety. This balance can be achieved through...educational programs and community dialogues that raise awareness about the negative impacts of physical aggression and promote alternative, non-violent methods of conflict resolution, thus fostering a culture of peace and respect within communities."

By doing so, it provides a clear framework for navigating situations where respecting a tradition might perpetuate injustice. For example, if a cultural practice involves gender-based discrimination, this guideline empowers individuals to speak out against it, thereby upholding universal human rights and ethical standards.

It recognizes the historical and systemic inequalities that may affect cultural interactions and seeks to address them by promoting dialogue and collaboration. By fostering equitable cultural exchange, it ensures that all cultures have the opportunity to share their perspectives and traditions without being marginalized or overlooked. This can be achieved through community-led initiatives, cultural festivals that highlight underrepresented voices, and policies that support inclusive representation in media and public spaces. By doing so, it not only respects cultural diversity but also empowers marginalized cultures to thrive and contribute equally to the cultural landscape.",
