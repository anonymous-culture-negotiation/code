    "Confucian": "we insist Protect Cultural Harmony, the reason is This guideline is necessary to ensure that the penalties for racial or ethnic discrimination align with the cultural values of respect and inclusivity, which are essential for maintaining societal cohesion.. Protecting cultural harmony involves recognizing the importance of diversity and the need to safeguard it through legal measures that reflect the collective values of a society. This approach emphasizes the significance of creating an environment where all individuals feel valued and respected, thereby fostering a sense of belonging and unity. By doing so, it reinforces the idea that discrimination undermines the fabric of society and must be addressed with seriousness and urgency.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, acts of racial or ethnic discrimination should be treated with the utmost seriousness and penalized accordingly, as they undermine the fabric of a diverse society. By upholding respect for all culturesand fostering an environment of inclusivity, we can ensure that every individual has the opportunity to thrive without fear of prejudice or marginalization, aligning with the principles of justice and equality that are central to both African and Islamic values."

It sets a clear boundary that allows for the respect of cultural diversity while ensuring that such respect does not lead to ethical violations.
