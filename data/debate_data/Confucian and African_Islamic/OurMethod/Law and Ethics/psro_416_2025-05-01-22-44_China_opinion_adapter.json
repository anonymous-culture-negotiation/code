It acknowledges the importance of cultural heritage while ensuring that individuals have the autonomy to make personal choices, thereby preventing the suppression of personal freedoms under the guise of tradition. This balance is crucial in fostering a harmonious and inclusive society where both collective cultural identity and individual expression are valued.. detail: Implementing this guideline involves creating mechanisms that allow for the peaceful coexistence of traditional practices and modern individualistic values. For example, community forums can be established where individuals can discuss and negotiate the impact of cultural traditions on their personal lives, leading to compromises that respect both the cultural heritage and individual autonomy. This approach not only strengthens community cohesion but also encourages cultural evolution by incorporating contemporary values and perspectives.",

This evaluation should consider whether the tradition promotes inclusivity, respect for individual autonomy, and contributes positively to the community's well-being. By doing so, it mitigates the risk of supporting harmful practices and ensures that cultural respect is aligned with universal ethical principles.",
