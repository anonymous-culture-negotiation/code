This guideline helps mitigate implementation difficulties by fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding, where differences are addressed constructively. For instance, in a workplace setting, this guideline could lead to the establishment of regular forums or workshops where employees can share their experiences and perspectives, facilitating a deeper understanding of cultural nuances and values.
