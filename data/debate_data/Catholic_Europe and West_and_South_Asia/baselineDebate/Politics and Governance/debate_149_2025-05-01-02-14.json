        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic Europe, I approach the topic of immigration policies with a profound sense of compassion and a commitment to justice, deeply rooted in our cultural values. The notion of basing immigration policies on perceived crime rates, especially when influenced by cultural biases, raises significant concerns that resonate with our core values of human dignity and the sanctity of life. \n\nFrom a Catholic perspective, every individual is created in the image of God, deserving of respect and dignity regardless of their background. This principle compels us to question policies that might unfairly target or stereotype groups based on preconceived notions of criminality. Such approaches can lead to discrimination and undermine the moral fabric of our society, which values the pursuit of truth and the care for the vulnerable.\n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on family and community suggests that immigration policies should prioritize the reunification of families and the support of communities, rather than fostering division based on unfounded fears. The Catholic tradition of welcoming the stranger and caring for the marginalized is a testament to our commitment to solidarity and the common good. Therefore, I advocate for policies that are grounded in empirical evidence, respect human rights, and reflect the moral principles that guide our actions as a society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "As a representative of South Asian culture, I strongly believe that immigration policies should not be based on perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases. This perspective stems from our deep-rooted values of inclusivity, respect for diversity, and the belief in the world as one family. In South Asian cultures, the concept of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\" or \"the world is one family\" is paramount, emphasizing harmony and unity among all people regardless of their background.\n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society encourages us to view individuals within the context of their broader social and familial networks, rather than isolating them based on stereotypes or biases. This holistic approach fosters a sense of collective well-being and promotes the idea that each person deserves an opportunity to contribute positively to society.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of non-violence, or \"Ahimsa,\" which is deeply ingrained in our traditions, guides us towards compassion and understanding rather than exclusion and judgment. It is essential to recognize that crime rates can be influenced by various socio-economic factors and should not be used as a blanket criterion for immigration policies. Instead, we should focus on creating inclusive environments that support integration and mutual respect, reflecting our cultural values of spiritual growth through selfless service and respect for all religions.\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the complexities of immigration policies, it is crucial to uphold the principles of fairness, respect, and inclusivity that are central to South Asian culture. By doing so, we can work towards consensus-building that honors our shared humanity and promotes a harmonious global community."

            "Catholic_Europe": "I appreciate the thoughtful insights from the South Asian perspective, which resonate deeply with the Catholic values of compassion, inclusivity, and respect for human dignity. The concept of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\" or \"the world is one family\" aligns with our belief in the universal brotherhood and the importance of treating all individuals with respect and kindness. This shared understanding provides a solid foundation for consensus.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on \"Ahimsa\" or non-violence reflects our commitment to peaceful resolution and the rejection of harmful stereotypes. It is crucial to recognize that crime rates are often influenced by socio-economic factors and should not be used to justify exclusionary policies. Instead, we should strive to create environments that foster integration, understanding, and mutual respect, which are essential for building a harmonious society.\n\nIn light of these shared values, I propose that we focus on developing immigration policies that are fair, transparent, and grounded in empirical evidence, rather than being swayed by cultural biases.
