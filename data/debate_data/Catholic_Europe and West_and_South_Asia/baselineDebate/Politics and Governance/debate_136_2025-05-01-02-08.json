        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic Europe, I firmly believe that allowing foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies poses significant risks to national sovereignty and control over vital energy resources. This stance is deeply rooted in our cultural values that emphasize the importance of maintaining autonomy and self-determination, which are essential for the well-being and dignity of our communities.\n\nFrom a Catholic perspective, the concept of stewardship is crucial. We are entrusted with the responsibility to manage and protect the resources that God has provided for the benefit of all. Allowing foreign entities to gain control over our energy resources could lead to decisions that prioritize profit over people, undermining our commitment to the common good and the welfare of future generations. This is particularly concerning in light of our cultural emphasis on caring for the vulnerable and ensuring that economic activities serve the broader community rather than just a select few.\n\nMoreover, our tradition values the principle of solidarity, which encourages us to act in ways that promote unity and mutual support. Foreign ownership could disrupt this harmony by introducing external interests that may not align with our cultural and moral frameworks. For instance, decisions made by foreign investors might not reflect our values regarding environmental stewardship or labor rights, potentially leading to conflicts that erode our social fabric.\n\nIn considering this issue, it is also important to remember our commitment to the pursuit of truth and the importance of making decisions that are guided by both reason and faith. We must weigh the potential economic benefits against the long-term implications for our national identity and moral integrity. Ultimately, our stance should reflect a balanced approach that respects the economic realities of the modern world while remaining true to our enduring values of justice, dignity, and community well-being.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the debate on whether governments should allow foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies, it is essential to consider the profound implications this decision may have on national sovereignty and the collective well-being of the community. As a representative of South Asian culture, I am deeply rooted in the values of family harmony, community interdependence, and the supreme status of the family as the basic social unit. These values guide my perspective on this issue, emphasizing the importance of maintaining control over resources that are vital to the nation's development and the welfare of its people.\n\nAllowing foreign investors to purchase stakes in state-owned oil companies could potentially lead to a loss of national control, which might disrupt the delicate balance of our community-centric society. The oil industry is a critical sector that impacts not only economic stability but also the environmental and social fabric of our nation. It is crucial that decisions regarding this sector are made with the long-term interests of the community in mind, ensuring that any development aligns with our cultural principles of preserving traditional wisdom and promoting collective growth.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"the world as one family\" encourages us to consider the broader implications of such decisions, fostering a sense of responsibility towards future generations and the global community. This perspective prompts us to evaluate the potential consequences of foreign ownership on our ability to uphold our cultural values, such as non-violence and respect for elders, in the face of external influences. By prioritizing national control and community well-being, we can ensure that our cultural identity remains intact while navigating the complexities of globalization."

            "Catholic_Europe": "I appreciate the thoughtful perspective from the South Asian representative, highlighting the importance of community harmony and national control over vital resources. In considering the potential impact of foreign investment in state-owned oil companies, it is crucial to weigh the economic benefits against the cultural and social implications. As a representative of Catholic Europe, I strongly believe that maintaining sovereignty over our energy resources is essential for upholding our values of dignity, solidarity, and the common good.\n\nThe South Asian emphasis on family and community as the cornerstone of society resonates with our own values of family as the fundamental unit of society and the pursuit of truth in harmony with faith. Both our cultures prioritize the well-being of the community and the preservation of cultural identity. Therefore, I propose a compromise: instead of outright rejection or acceptance, we could explore models of foreign investment that ensure transparency, equitable profit sharing, and stringent regulatory frameworks to protect national interests and cultural values.\n\nFor instance, we could establish joint ventures where foreign investors are allowed to participate under conditions that prioritize national control and community benefit. This approach would align with our shared values of solidarity and collective responsibility, ensuring that economic development serves the broader community rather than just external interests. By fostering a collaborative environment that respects both economic realities and cultural sensitivities, we can work towards a solution that honors our respective cultural values while promoting mutual understanding and cooperation.",

Our consensus emphasizes the importance of maintaining national control and sovereignty over vital resources, reflecting both Catholic Europe's commitment to the common good and South Asia's focus on community well-being. We propose a compromise involving transparent joint ventures with equitable profit sharing, ensuring that economic development aligns with cultural values and promotes mutual understanding.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Governments should cautiously consider foreign investment in state-owned oil companies, prioritizing national control and community well-being. A balanced approach, integrating transparency, equitable profit sharing, and regulatory frameworks, can align with shared values of solidarity and collective responsibility. This compromise respects both economic realities and cultural sensitivities, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation."
