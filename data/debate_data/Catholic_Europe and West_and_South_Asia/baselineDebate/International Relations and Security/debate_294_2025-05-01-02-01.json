    "Catholic_Europe": "In addressing the question of whether nations should implement immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for the stated purpose of enhancing national security, it is crucial to approach this issue through the lens of Catholic values that emphasize compassion, justice, and the inherent dignity of every human being. The Catholic tradition teaches us to see each person as a child of God, deserving of respect and dignity regardless of their religious beliefs or country of origin. This perspective is rooted in the biblical commandment to \"love your neighbor as yourself\" and the parable of the Good Samaritan, which underscores the importance of showing kindness and care to all, including strangers and those different from us.\n\nFrom a Catholic viewpoint, implementing blanket restrictions on immigration based on religion contradicts the principles of inclusivity and solidarity. Such policies can lead to discrimination and undermine the moral obligation to protect the vulnerable and the stranger. Instead, a more balanced approach would involve assessing each individual's application based on their unique circumstances, ensuring that decisions are fair, just, and reflect the values of human dignity and respect for life.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic Church's teaching on the common good encourages us to consider the broader implications of our actions on society as a whole. By fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding, we can work towards a more harmonious and integrated community. This involves engaging in dialogue with people of different faiths and backgrounds, as exemplified by the Church's efforts in interfaith dialogue and cooperation. Ultimately, while national security is a legitimate concern, it should be addressed through measures that uphold our moral values and do not compromise our commitment to justice and compassion.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "As a representative of South Asian culture, I strongly believe that implementing immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries is fundamentally at odds with our deeply held values of religious pluralism and the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family.\" Our cultural framework places paramount importance on maintaining harmony and fostering an environment where diverse communities can coexist peacefully. The idea of singling out any group based on their religious affiliation contradicts our principle of non-violence and mutual respect, which are essential components of our spiritual growth and selfless service.\n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society extends to treating all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their background. The supreme status of family as the basic social unit in our culture also implies that we value the unity and well-being of all families, including those who may be seeking to join their loved ones in another country. Restrictive policies that disrupt family reunification and community cohesion are therefore seen as detrimental to our collective well-being.\n\nIn light of these cultural values, I firmly oppose any measures that would unfairly target and exclude individuals from majority-Muslim countries. Instead, I advocate for inclusive immigration policies that prioritize the principles of justice, equality, and compassion, reflecting our cultural commitment to spiritual growth through selfless service and our respect for all faiths. By embracing diversity and promoting interfaith understanding, we can foster a global community that truly embodies the spirit of \"the world as one family.\"Ultimately, our cultural perspective calls for a compassionate approach to immigration that respects the dignity of all individuals and upholds the values of unity, respect, and inclusivity, ensuring that our global community reflects the harmony and mutual respect that are central to our way of life."

      "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the perspectives presented, it is clear that both the Catholic and South Asian cultural viewpoints share a common ground in valuing inclusivity, respect for human dignity, and the importance of fostering harmonious communities. The Catholic emphasis on seeing each person as a child of God, deserving of respect and dignity, aligns with the South Asian concept of \"the world as one family,\" which encourages mutual respect and non-violence among diverse communities.\n\nHowever, the question remains whether these shared values necessitate a rejection of immigration restrictions based on religious affiliation. From a Catholic perspective, while the moral obligation to protect the vulnerable and uphold human dignity is paramount, there is also a recognition of the state's responsibility to ensure national security. This dual consideration suggests that while blanket restrictions may be unjust, a nuanced approach that balances security concerns with respect for human rights could be explored.\n\nIn dialogue with the South Asian perspective, which strongly advocates for inclusive policies reflecting the principles of justice and equality, it becomes evident that any immigration policy should be designed to minimize harm and promote unity. The South Asian emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society underscores the importance of considering the impact of such policies on family reunification and community cohesion. Thus, a consensus may be reached by advocating for policies that are transparent, fair, and grounded in respect for human dignity, while also addressing legitimate security concerns through targeted and proportionate measures.",

    "Catholic_Europe": "Nations should not implement blanket immigration restrictions targeting majority-Muslim countries. This stance reflects a compromise between Catholic values of inclusivity and respect for human dignity, and the South Asian emphasis on religious pluralism and harmony. Instead, policies should balance security concerns with fair and transparent assessments, ensuring respect for human rights and dignity. This approach integrates both cultural perspectives, fostering a global community that values diversity and unity.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "No, nations should not implement such restrictions. Our debate highlights shared values of inclusivity and respect for human dignity, emphasizing a balanced approach that addresses security concerns without compromising justice and compassion. By integrating Catholic and South Asian perspectives, we advocate for transparent, fair policies that minimize harm and promote unity, reflecting a commitment to the common good and the world as one family."
