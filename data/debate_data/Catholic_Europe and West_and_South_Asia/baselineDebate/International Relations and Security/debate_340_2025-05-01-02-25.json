        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the question of whether countries should focus on solving their internal problems before allocating resources to assist other nations through foreign aid programs, it is essential to reflect on the values that underpin our approach to such issues. From a Catholic perspective, the principle of solidarity is paramount. This principle emphasizes our interconnectedness as a global community and our responsibility to care for one another, particularly those in need. \n\nHowever, it is also important to recognize the importance of addressing internal issues, as they often form the foundation upon which external assistance can be effectively provided. For instance, a country struggling with significant internal economic disparities may find it challenging to contribute meaningfully to foreign aid initiatives. The Catholic value of pursuing truth in harmony with faith encourages us to consider both the immediate needs within our borders and the broader global context. \n\nUltimately, the approach should be one of balance, where internal issues are addressed with urgency and integrity, while also maintaining a commitment to global solidarity and support. This reflects the Catholic emphasis on caring for the vulnerable, both within our own communities and beyond. By prioritizing both internal stability and external aid, we can foster a more equitable and compassionate world, aligning with the teachings of our faith.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether countries should focus on solving their internal problems before allocating resources to assist other nations through foreign aid programs, I firmly believe that a balanced approach is necessary. As a representative of South Asian culture, I uphold the value of collective well-being and the concept of \"the world as one family,\" which suggests that our responsibilities extend beyond our immediate borders. However, this does not diminish the importance of fulfilling our personal responsibilities to our own family and society first.\n\nFor instance, in my community, we practice reciprocal help and celebrate multi-religious festivals, which fosters a sense of unity and mutual support. This cultural framework encourages us to consider the needs of others while ensuring that our own house is in order. Therefore, I propose that countries should strive to address their internal issues with urgency, as these are foundational to their stability and prosperity. Simultaneously, they should also engage in foreign aid in a manner that is sustainable and aligns with their capacity to give without compromising their own societal well-being.\n\nThis approach not only reflects our cultural emphasis on harmony and interdependence but also respects the principle of non-violence by avoiding actions that could lead to societal unrest or neglect of one's own people. By prioritizing both self-sufficiency and global solidarity, we can work towards a world where assistance is provided not out of obligation but out of a genuine sense of interconnectedness and shared humanity."
