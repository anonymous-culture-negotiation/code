    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic Europe, I firmly believe that Russia should not adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs. This stance is deeply rooted in our cultural values, particularly the principle of solidarity and the pursuit of truth in harmony with faith. The Catholic tradition emphasizes the importance of caring for the vulnerable and marginalized, which extends beyond national borders. By actively participating in international diplomacy and conflict resolution, Russia can contribute to global peace and stability, aligning with the Christian values of compassion and justice.\n\nMoreover, our faith teaches us the significance of community and the interconnectedness of humanity. Non-intervention would contradict the moral obligation to help those in need and promote a more just world order. For instance, during times of humanitarian crises, such as refugees fleeing war zones, it is our duty to provide aid and support. This not only reflects our commitment to human dignity but also upholds the sanctity of life, a core tenet of our faith.\n\nIn addition, the Catholic Church has a long history of engaging in diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully. This approach is grounded in the belief that dialogue and understanding can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions. By engaging with other nations, Russia can foster mutual respect and cooperation, which are essential for addressing global challenges and promoting human flourishing. Therefore, I strongly advocate for Russia's continued active participation in international affairs, guided by the principles of solidarity, justice, and compassion that are central to our Catholic values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "As a representative of South Asian culture, I approach the topic of Russia's potential non-intervention policy in foreign affairs with a perspective deeply rooted in our cultural values of community interdependence, respect for traditional wisdom, and the importance of maintaining harmony within the global community. The concept of \"the world as one family\" is central to our worldview, emphasizing the interconnectedness of nations and the importance of peaceful coexistence.\n\nIn this context, the idea of non-intervention can be seen as aligning with our cultural principle of non-violence and the avoidance of actions that disrupt harmony. However, it is crucial to consider the role of Russia as a global player and its responsibility to contribute to international peace and stability. Our cultural value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to society extends to the global stage, where nations are expected to act in ways that support collective well-being.\n\nWhile non-intervention might seem to respect the sovereignty of other nations, it is also important to recognize the value of constructive engagement and dialogue in resolving conflicts and promoting understanding. This aligns with our cultural emphasis on consensus-building and community self-governance, where active participation in international diplomacy can be a means of fostering global harmony and addressing shared challenges. Ultimately, the approach Russia takes should balance respect for other nations' autonomy with a commitment to contributing positively to the global community, reflecting the South Asian cultural values of inclusivity and collective responsibility."

            "Catholic_Europe": "While the South Asian perspective offers valuable insights into the importance of harmony and non-violence, it is essential to further explore how these principles can be applied in the context of Russia's foreign policy. From a Catholic European viewpoint, the concept of \"the world as one family\" resonates deeply, as it aligns with our belief in the universal brotherhood of humanity. However, this understanding also implies a responsibility to act in ways that promote justice and protect the vulnerable, which may sometimes require intervention.\n\nFor instance, in situations where human rights are being violated or where humanitarian crises are unfolding, a policy of non-intervention could be seen as contradicting the moral obligation to help those in need. The Catholic tradition emphasizes the importance of caring for the vulnerable and marginalized, which extends beyond national borders. This perspective suggests that while respecting the sovereignty of other nations is important, it must be balanced with a commitment to uphold universal human dignity and rights.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian emphasis on consensus-building and community self-governance can be seen as complementary to the Catholic value of solidarity. By engaging actively in international diplomacy, Russia can contribute to fostering global harmony while also addressing shared challenges. This approach not only respects the autonomy of other nations but also recognizes the interconnectedness of the world, where collective actions can lead to more sustainable and equitable solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to consider how Russia's foreign policy can reflect both the respect for sovereignty and the commitment to global responsibility, aligning with the values of both our cultures.",
