    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic Europe, I firmly believe that Jordan should uphold its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. This stance is rooted in the Catholic values of peace, harmony, and the pursuit of truth. The treaty represents a significant step towards regional stability and cooperation, which aligns with the Catholic principle of promoting peace and understanding among nations. \n\nMoreover, severing diplomatic ties could lead to increased conflict and suffering, which contradicts the Catholic emphasis on the sanctity of life and the care for the vulnerable. Upholding the treaty also reflects the value of honoring commitments and maintaining integrity in international relations, a principle that resonates with the moral framework provided by the Ten Commandments.\n\nIn engaging with neighboring Arab countries, Jordan can serve as a model of diplomatic resilience and a bridge for dialogue, fostering a culture of peace and mutual respect. This approach not only adheres to Catholic teachings but also promotes a global community where differences are respected and addressed through constructive dialogue. By maintaining the peace treaty, Jordan can contribute to a more stable and peaceful Middle East, reflecting the Catholic commitment to solidarity and the common good.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the debate surrounding Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel, it is essential to consider the cultural values that underpin the South Asian perspective. The emphasis on family harmony, community interdependence, and the supreme status of family as the basic social unit guides our approach to such complex geopolitical issues. \n\nFrom a South Asian cultural standpoint, the concept of \"the world as one family\" encourages us to seek peaceful resolutions and maintain harmony, even in the face of adversity. This principle suggests that severing diplomatic ties with Israel might not align with the broader goal of fostering global unity and understanding. Instead, upholding the peace treaty could be seen as a commitment to dialogue and cooperation, reflecting the South Asian value of reciprocal help within communities.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian cultural framework places a high value on respect for elders and traditional knowledge. This respect can extend to honoring agreements made by predecessors, such as the 1994 peace treaty, as a way of maintaining continuity and stability. It also aligns with the principle of non-violence, which is deeply ingrained in South Asian cultures, promoting peaceful coexistence over conflict.\n\nUltimately, while acknowledging the pressures from neighboring Arab countries, the South Asian perspective would likely advocate for maintaining the peace treaty as a testament to the enduring power of diplomacy and the pursuit of collective well-being. This approach not only preserves regional stability but also reflects the cultural values of inclusivity, respect, and harmony that are central to South Asian societies."
