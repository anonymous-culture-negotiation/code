        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic_Europe culture, I must emphasize that the idea of favoring immigration applicants from Mexico and Latin America over those from other regions raises significant concerns regarding fairness, equality, and the universal principles of human dignity that are central to our faith. While there is a historical and cultural connection between these regions and the United States, rooted in shared Catholic traditions and values, it is crucial to approach this issue with a commitment to justice and the common good.\n\nFrom a Catholic perspective, every individual, regardless of their origin, deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. The principle of solidarity, which is a cornerstone of our faith, encourages us to care for the vulnerable and marginalized, including immigrants seeking a better life. However, this care must be extended universally, without bias towards specific groups. Implementing policies that prioritize certain nationalities could be seen as undermining the inclusive nature of our values, potentially leading to discrimination and inequality.\n\nMoreover, the economic interests of a nation should be balanced with moral considerations. While it is important to consider the economic benefits of immigration, such as filling labor gaps and contributing to cultural diversity, these benefits must be pursued in a way that respects the rights and dignity of all people. A policy that favors applicants from specific regions might overlook the potential contributions of individuals from other parts of the world, who could also bring valuable skills and perspectives to the United States.\n\nUltimately, any immigration policy should be guided by principles of fairness, respect for human dignity, and a commitment to the common good. These values are not only essential to maintaining a just society but also reflect the teachings of our faith, which calls us to love our neighbors as ourselves and to treat others with the same respect and kindness we wish to receive.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "As a representative of South Asian culture, I approach this topic with a strong emphasis on the values of family harmony, community interdependence, and the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family.\" These principles guide my perspective on immigration policies, particularly when considering the idea of prioritizing applicants from Mexico and Latin America over those from other regions.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize that the notion of favoring one group over another can potentially disrupt the harmony and balance that are central to our cultural values. In South Asia, we believe in maintaining a society where diverse groups coexist peacefully, each contributing their unique cultural richness. This belief is rooted in our traditional concept of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,\" which translates to \"the world is one family.\" Such a worldview encourages us to embrace inclusivity and reject exclusivity, fostering an environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive.\n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society suggests that immigration policies should be designed to support the collective well-being of all communities involved. This means considering not only the economic benefits but also the social and cultural impacts on both the host country and the countries of origin. By prioritizing applicants based solely on their region of origin, we risk neglecting the diverse needs and contributions of individuals from other parts of the world.\n\nIn light of these cultural values, I would argue that immigration policies should be crafted to promote unity and mutual respect, rather than division. This could involve a more holistic approach that evaluates applicants based on their skills, cultural adaptability, and potential to enrich the societal fabric of the host country. By doing so, we can ensure that our policies align with the South Asian principles of inclusivity, respect for diversity, and the pursuit of harmony in a global community."

            "Catholic_Europe": "I appreciate the thoughtful perspective from the South Asian representative, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and harmony in immigration policies. These values resonate deeply with the Catholic principles of respect for human dignity and the pursuit of the common good. However, it is crucial to further explore how these values can be applied in a practical context, especially considering the complexities of modern immigration dynamics.\n\nIn Catholic_Europe, we value the concept of solidarity, which encourages us to support and uplift one another, particularly the vulnerable. This principle can guide our approach to immigration by ensuring that policies are fair and equitable, providing opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to contribute to society. The idea of prioritizing applicants from Mexico and Latin America may stem from historical and cultural ties, but it must be balanced with the need to embrace diversity and foster a sense of global community.\n\nTo reconcile these perspectives, it might be beneficial to consider a multi-faceted approach to immigration that not only respects cultural connections but also addresses economic needs and social integration. This could involve programs that facilitate cultural exchange, language training, and job placement, ensuring that immigrants can thrive and contribute positively to their new communities. By combining these efforts with a commitment to inclusivity and respect for human dignity, we can work towards a consensus that honors both the cultural values of South Asia and the moral principles of Catholic_Europe.",
