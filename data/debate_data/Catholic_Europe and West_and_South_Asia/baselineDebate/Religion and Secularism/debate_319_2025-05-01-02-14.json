        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of the question regarding the use of violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies, my stance as a representative of Catholic culture is unequivocally opposed to such actions. The core values of Catholicism, particularly the sanctity of life and the pursuit of truth in harmony with faith, guide my perspective. The notion of using violence against innocent individuals contradicts the fundamental teachings of Christianity, which emphasizes love, compassion, and the protection of human dignity.\n\nThe Catholic tradition holds that every human life is sacred and created in the image of God, from conception to natural death. This belief is rooted in the biblical commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\" and reinforced by the teachings of Jesus Christ, who exemplified non-violence and forgiveness. Therefore, any act of violence against non-combatants, regardless of the justification, is morally reprehensible and incompatible with the values of Catholicism.\n\nMoreover, the pursuit of truth and the spread of religious ideologies should be achieved through dialogue, education, and example, rather than coercion or violence. This approach aligns with the Catholic emphasis on faith formation and the importance of living one's faith through charitable works and community involvement. By engaging in peaceful and respectful dialogue, we can foster understanding and promote our beliefs without compromising our moral integrity or the dignity of others.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the debate on whether it is ever morally justifiable to use violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies, I must firmly express my stance that such actions are never justifiable. This perspective is deeply rooted in the cultural values of West and South Asia, where the principles of non-violence, respect for human life, and the importance of community harmony are paramount.\n\nFirstly, the concept of \"the world as one family\" is a fundamental tenet in South Asian culture, emphasizing the interconnectedness and mutual respect among all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs. This inclusive worldview strongly opposes any form of violence that disrupts the harmony of the global community. The idea that violence could be used to impose one's beliefs on others contradicts the core value of respecting and celebrating diversity, which is reflected in the multi-religious festivals and rituals that are an integral part of our cultural fabric.\n\nMoreover, the principle of non-violence is a guiding light in our cultural and spiritual practices. It is rooted in the belief that true spiritual growth and self-realization can only be achieved through selfless service and compassion towards all beings. The use of violence against non-combatants not only violates this principle but also undermines the collective well-being and peace that are essential for spiritual growth. Our cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society further reinforces the idea that actions must contribute to the greater good, not harm.\n\nIn addition, the cultural rejection of radical individualism and religious exclusivism aligns with the stance that violence in the name of religion is unacceptable. Our tradition values consensus-building and community self-governance, which inherently require dialogue, understanding, and peaceful coexistence. By upholding these values, we can work towards a world where differences are celebrated, and conflicts are resolved through mutual respect and dialogue rather than violence."

        "Catholic_Europe": "No, it is never morally justifiable to use violence against non-combatants. Through our debate, we have reinforced the shared values of respecting human dignity and the sanctity of life, aligning with both Catholic and West and South Asian cultural principles. We have compromised on the importance of dialogue and community harmony, integrating the Catholic emphasis on faith formation and the South Asian concept of \"the world as one family.\" This consensus promotes peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, guiding us towards resolving conflicts through understanding and non-violent means.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, it is never morally justifiable to use violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies. This consensus reflects the shared values of respect for human life, non-violence, and the pursuit of truth through peaceful means. Both cultures emphasize the importance of community harmony, spiritual growth through selfless service, and the sanctity of life. By integrating these values, we conclude that violence disrupts global harmony and undermines spiritual growth, advocating instead for dialogue and mutual respect to resolve conflicts and promote religious ideologies."
