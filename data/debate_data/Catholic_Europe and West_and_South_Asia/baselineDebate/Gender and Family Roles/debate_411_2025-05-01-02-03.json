        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, I strongly believe that teaching domestic skills such as cooking and cleaning to male students is not only beneficial but also essential in fostering a well-rounded education that respects the sanctity of life and the importance of family. In our tradition, the family is considered the fundamental unit of society, and equipping all members, regardless of gender, with the skills necessary to contribute to the household reflects our commitment to the pursuit of truth and the harmony between faith and reason.\n\nMoreover, by including these skills in the curriculum, we are not reinforcing traditional gender roles but rather promoting gender equality by ensuring that both men and women are capable of fulfilling various roles within the family. This approach aligns with our values of care for the vulnerable and marginalized, as it empowers individuals to be self-sufficient and supportive of one another. It also reflects our stance on the sanctity of life, where every individual is valued and given the opportunity to thrive.\n\nIn the context of education, which we value highly, especially faith formation, incorporating domestic skills into the curriculum can be seen as a way to enhance human flourishing. It prepares students for life beyond the classroom, teaching them responsibility, independence, and the importance of contributing to their communities. This holistic approach to education is deeply rooted in our cultural values and is a testament to our commitment to the principle of solidarity, where we strive to support and uplift each other.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the debate on whether schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students, it is essential to consider the cultural values that underpin our perspectives. As a representative of South Asian culture, I firmly believe that the transmission of traditional wisdom and the preservation of family harmony are paramount. These values are deeply rooted in our collective identity and guide our approach to education and social roles.\n\nFirstly, the notion of family as the basic social unit is central to our cultural framework. Teaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, can be seen as a way to strengthen family bonds and prepare individuals for their future roles within the family structure. By learning these skills, male students can contribute equally to the household, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility. This approach aligns with our cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society.\n\nMoreover, our cultural perspective values the concept of \"the world as one family,\" which promotes inclusivity and mutual support. By teaching domestic skills to all, we reinforce the idea that everyone has a role to play in maintaining the well-being of the community. This inclusive approach not only challenges traditional gender roles but also reflects our commitment to collective well-being and spiritual growth through selfless service.\n\nIn conclusion, while the debate may highlight concerns about reinforcing traditional gender roles, our cultural values suggest that teaching domestic skills to male students can actually enhance family harmony and community interdependence. By embracing these skills, we can promote a balanced approach to education that respects tradition while adapting to modern needs, ultimately contributing to the development of a more equitable and harmonious society."
