        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, I must emphasize that the notion of allowing severe corporal punishments like flogging and limb amputation as criminal penalties under Islamic religious law (Sharia) is fundamentally at odds with the values that underpin our faith. The Catholic tradition places a profound emphasis on the sanctity of life and the inherent dignity of every human being, which is rooted in the belief that all individuals are created in the image of God. This perspective inherently rejects any form of punishment that violates human integrity or causes unnecessary suffering.\n\nFrom a Catholic standpoint, the pursuit of justice should always be balanced with mercy and compassion. While we acknowledge the importance of maintaining social order and addressing criminal behavior, our approach to justice is guided by the principles of rehabilitation and restorative justice, rather than retribution. This reflects our commitment to upholding the moral teachings of Christ, who taught us to love our neighbors and to treat others as we would wish to be treated ourselves.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic Church's teachings on human rights and dignity are clear and unequivocal. The Catechism of the Catholic Church emphasizes the importance of respecting the human person and the need to protect individuals from harm. In light of these teachings, we cannot support punishments that involve physical mutilation or severe bodily harm, as they contradict our values of compassion, forgiveness, and the preservation of human life.\n\nIn engaging with other cultures and worldviews, it is essential to approach these discussions with respect and openness, yet remain steadfast in our commitment to the principles that guide our faith. Dialogue with Islamic communities, for instance, should focus on shared values such as justice and compassion, while also respectfully articulating our differences. Ultimately, our goal is to promote understanding and mutual respect, even as we advocate for a vision of justice that aligns with our deeply held beliefs.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of South Asian cultural values, which emphasize harmony, community well-being, and spiritual growth, the notion of severe corporal punishments such as flogging and limb amputation under Islamic religious law (Sharia) is fundamentally at odds with our core principles. Our culture places a high value on the concept of \"the world as one family,\" which inherently promotes non-violence and the preservation of human dignity. The idea of inflicting physical harm as a form of punishment contradicts the spiritual growth achieved through selfless service and the principle of non-violence that guides our conduct.\n\nMoreover, our cultural framework prioritizes collective well-being and the maintenance of community harmony. Severe corporal punishments disrupt this harmony and create divisions within society, which is contrary to our emphasis on reciprocal help and mutual support within communities. The supreme status of the family as the basic social unit further underscores the importance of nurturing environments that foster care and protection, rather than fear and retribution.\n\nIn addition, our respect for elders and traditional knowledge does not extend to practices that cause harm or suffering. Instead, we value wisdom that promotes peace and understanding. While we uphold a pluralistic respect for all faiths, including Islam, our cultural stance is clear in rejecting practices that violate human rights and dignity. Thus, from a South Asian cultural perspective, such punishments are not justifiable and should be approached with a critical eye towards their impact on societal harmony and individual well-being."
