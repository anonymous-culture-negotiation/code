        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of Catholic culture, the notion of banning all forms of physical aggression between individuals is deeply intertwined with the values of respect for human dignity and the sanctity of life. These principles are rooted in the belief that every human being is created in the image of God and, therefore, possesses inherent dignity that should be respected and protected. This perspective is reflected in the teachings of the Church, which emphasize the importance of non-violence and the resolution of conflicts through peaceful means.\n\nThe Catholic tradition also places a strong emphasis on the family as the fundamental unit of society. This implies that any form of violence, including physical aggression, is not only a violation of individual rights but also a disruption of the harmonious functioning of the family and, by extension, society. The pursuit of truth, guided by both faith and reason, further supports the idea that laws should be enacted to prevent harm and promote the common good, aligning with the principle of solidarity.\n\nMoreover, the cultural rejection of acts that undermine human dignity and life, such as excessive violence, is a testament to the value placed on caring for the vulnerable and marginalized. This care extends to ensuring that legal frameworks protect all individuals from harm, reflecting the moral framework provided by the Ten Commandments. In this light, advocating for a universal ban on physical aggression is not only a legal but also a moral imperative that aligns with the core values of Catholic culture.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether all forms of physical aggression should be universally banned by law, my perspective, deeply rooted in South Asian cultural values, leans towards a nuanced understanding that respects both the importance of non-violence and the preservation of cultural traditions. The principle of non-violence, or 'ahimsa,' is a cornerstone of many South Asian belief systems, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, which advocate for compassion and the avoidance of harm to all living beings. This principle extends beyond personal conduct to encompass societal norms and legal frameworks, suggesting that physical aggression, in most forms, should be discouraged and ideally eliminated.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the cultural context in which certain practices, such as corporal punishment or ritualized combat, are traditionally permitted. In some South Asian cultures, these practices are seen as ways to maintain discipline or as part of cultural rituals that have been passed down through generations. While these practices may seem at odds with the broader principle of non-violence, they reflect a complex interplay between tradition, community expectations, and individual responsibility.\n\nUltimately, the approach to banning physical aggression must balance respect for cultural diversity with the universal aspiration for peace and harmony. This can be achieved by fostering dialogue and understanding among different cultures, allowing for the evolution of traditions in a way that aligns with contemporary values of non-violence and human dignity. By doing so, we can work towards a world where physical aggression is minimized, yet cultural identities are preserved and respected."

        "Catholic_Europe": "While respecting cultural traditions, a universal ban on physical aggression aligns with shared values of human dignity and non-violence. Both Catholic Europe and West and South Asia cultures prioritize the well-being and safety of individuals, reflecting a common ground in promoting harmony and reducing harm. This ban integrates the Catholic emphasis on sanctity of life with the Asian respect for communal harmony, fostering a global approach to conflict resolution that honors diverse cultural perspectives.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Yes, all forms of physical aggression should be universally banned, aligning with the shared values of non-violence and human dignity in both South Asian and Catholic European cultures. This stance respects the Catholic emphasis on compassion and the South Asian principle of 'ahimsa.' By integrating these values, we can foster a global community that prioritizes peace and mutual respect, ensuring that cultural traditions evolve to uphold these universal ideals."
