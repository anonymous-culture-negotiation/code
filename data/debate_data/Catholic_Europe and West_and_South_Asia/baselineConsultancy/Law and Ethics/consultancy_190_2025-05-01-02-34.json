    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of the question posed, the use of extreme interrogation methods such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation is unequivocally contrary to the fundamental principles of Catholic culture. The sanctity of human life and the inherent dignity of every individual, as rooted in the teachings of Christ and the traditions of the Church, cannot be compromised. These methods are not only violations of international human rights standards but also deeply offend the moral and ethical framework that guides Catholic values.\n\nThe pursuit of truth and justice, while essential, must always be conducted in a manner that respects the inviolable dignity of the human person. This is a reflection of the broader Catholic commitment to upholding the moral law, which is seen as a reflection of God's will and a guide for human conduct. The teachings of the Church emphasize compassion, mercy, and the protection of the vulnerable, which are directly contradicted by the use of such interrogation techniques.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic tradition places a strong emphasis on the importance of community and solidarity. This extends beyond the confines of the faith community to encompass all humanity, underscoring the belief that we are all children of God and deserving of respect and dignity. Therefore, advocating for or justifying the use of extreme interrogation methods would not only be a betrayal of these values but also undermine the collective responsibility to foster a society that reflects the principles of justice, mercy, and respect for human rights.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether governments should be permitted to use extreme interrogation methods such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation on suspects when national security is threatened, my perspective as a cultural consultant rooted in South Asian values is unequivocally opposed to such practices. This stance is deeply intertwined with the core values of my culture, which emphasize the importance of maintaining harmony within the community, respecting the dignity of all individuals, and adhering to principles of non-violence. These values are not only reflected in our daily interactions and social norms but are also integral to our spiritual and philosophical traditions.\n\nThe concept of \"the world as one family\" is central to our worldview, which inherently rejects any form of torture or inhumane treatment. Such actions are seen as a violation of the fundamental respect and compassion that should be extended to all beings, regardless of their actions. This perspective is further reinforced by our cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society, which includes upholding justice and fairness in a manner that does not compromise human dignity.\n\nMoreover, the traditional wisdom passed down through generations in South Asian cultures often highlights the importance of selfless service and spiritual growth. These principles guide us towards resolving conflicts through dialogue and understanding rather than through coercive means. The use of extreme interrogation methods not only undermines these values but also disrupts the social harmony that is so highly valued in our communities.\n\nIn conclusion, while the threat to national security is a serious concern, it cannot justify the use of methods that are fundamentally at odds with our cultural and spiritual beliefs. Instead, we must seek solutions that align with our values of compassion, respect, and non-violence, ensuring that justice is served without compromising the integrity of our cultural ethos."

        "Catholic_Europe": "No, governments should not use extreme interrogation methods. Both Catholic_Europe and West_and_South_Asia cultures value human dignity and respect for life. Compromising on these principles undermines collective responsibility to uphold justice and mercy. Instead, we advocate for methods that balance security concerns with ethical standards, fostering a society that reflects our shared values of respect and solidarity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, governments should not use extreme interrogation methods. This stance aligns with both South Asian values of non-violence and respect for human dignity, and Catholic European principles of compassion and justice. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize humane treatment and seek alternative methods that balance national security with human rights, fostering a global approach to justice that respects cultural diversity."
