        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, I firmly believe that governments should not actively encourage Islamic religious practices among Muslim citizens if it conflicts with the principles of secularism. This stance is rooted in the Catholic value of respecting the separation of church and state, which is a cornerstone of modern democracies. While Catholicism emphasizes the importance of religious freedom and the right to practice one's faith, it also recognizes the need for a secular framework that ensures equality and fairness for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs.\n\nIn countries where religious importance is declining, the focus should be on fostering a society that values pluralism and inclusivity, rather than promoting any particular religion. This approach aligns with the Catholic principle of solidarity, which encourages mutual respect and support among diverse groups. By maintaining a secular stance, governments can ensure that all citizens, including Muslims, are free to practice their religion without coercion or favoritism, reflecting the Catholic value of respecting individual conscience and autonomy.\n\nMoreover, promoting Islamic practices in a secular context could lead to conflicts with other religious groups and potentially undermine social cohesion. The Catholic tradition values harmony and peaceful coexistence, emphasizing the importance of dialogue and mutual understanding. Therefore, it is crucial for governments to uphold secular principles while allowing religious communities to flourish independently, ensuring that the rights of all citizens are protected and respected.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of countries where religious importance is declining, the question of whether governments should actively encourage Islamic religious practices among Muslim citizens, even if it conflicts with principles of secularism, is a complex one. From the perspective of South Asian culture, which places a high value on family harmony, community interdependence, and spiritual growth through selfless service, the approach to this issue would likely emphasize the importance of maintaining a balance between respecting individual religious freedoms and fostering a pluralistic society.\n\nIn South Asia, the concept of \"the world as one family\" is deeply ingrained, suggesting that diverse religious practices can coexist peacefully under the umbrella of mutual respect and understanding. This perspective aligns with the cultural value of respecting elders and traditional knowledge, which includes religious teachings. Therefore, while the government may have a role in supporting religious practices, it is crucial that this support does not undermine the principles of secularism or create divisions within the community.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on non-violence and the rejection of radical individualism suggest that any governmental encouragement of religious practices should be done in a way that promotes harmony and inclusivity. This could involve initiatives that celebrate multi-religious festivals and rituals, fostering a sense of unity and shared cultural heritage. Ultimately, the goal would be to ensure that religious practices contribute to the collective well-being of society, reflecting the core South Asian value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society."

However, they can support cultural and religious diversity through inclusive policies, fostering dialogue and mutual respect. This approach respects individual freedoms while promoting social cohesion, aligning with Catholic values of harmony and solidarity, and West and South Asia's emphasis on community and cultural preservation.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Governments should support Islamic practices while upholding secularism, fostering a harmonious, pluralistic society. This approach aligns with South Asia's emphasis on community and respect for traditions, while considering Catholic Europe's values of inclusivity and social cohesion. By promoting interfaith dialogue and cultural exchange, we can ensure religious practices enrich collective well-being, reflecting shared values of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence."
