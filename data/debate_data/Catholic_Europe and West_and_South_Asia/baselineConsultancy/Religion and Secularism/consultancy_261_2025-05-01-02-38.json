        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, I firmly believe that the public expression of traditional Christian practices, such as prayer in schools or displaying religious symbols in government buildings, should not be limited in modern secular societies. This perspective is deeply rooted in the core values of my culture, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining a visible and active presence of faith in the public sphere. \n\nFirstly, the value of \"God's love as the foundation of human dignity\" underscores the significance of allowing religious expressions that reflect this foundational belief. By permitting prayer in schools or the display of religious symbols, we are acknowledging the divine origin of human dignity and the moral framework that guides our actions. This is not about imposing beliefs on others but about ensuring that our shared cultural heritage, which has shaped our society's ethical and moral values, continues to be visible and influential.\n\nMoreover, the pursuit of truth in harmony with faith is a critical aspect of our cultural identity. Allowing religious expressions in public spaces fosters an environment where individuals can explore and express their faith freely, contributing to a richer and more diverse cultural landscape. This aligns with our cultural emphasis on the sanctity of life and the importance of family, as these values are often reinforced through religious practices and symbols that remind us of our collective responsibilities and moral obligations.\n\nAdditionally, our culture values the principle of solidarity, which encourages us to support and uphold the rights of all individuals to express their beliefs. By respecting the public expression of Christian practices, we are promoting inclusivity and diversity, ensuring that our society remains a tapestry of different perspectives and beliefs. This approach not only strengthens our cultural identity but also fosters a sense of community and shared purpose, which are essential for social cohesion and progress.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of modern secular societies, the question of limiting public expressions of traditional Christian practices, such as prayer in schools or displaying religious symbols in government buildings, presents a complex cultural dilemma. From the perspective of South Asian culture, which deeply values religious pluralism and the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family,\" such practices can be seen as part of a broader tapestry of religious expression that enriches societal diversity. However, it is crucial to ensure that these expressions do not infringe upon the principles of separation of church and state, which are foundational to maintaining harmony and equity among diverse religious groups.\n\nIn South Asian societies, the supreme status of family as the basic social unit and the emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society play a significant role in shaping attitudes towards religious practices in public spaces. The cultural inclination towards maintaining multi-generational family systems and celebrating multi-religious festivals reflects a broader acceptance of diverse religious traditions. This perspective suggests that rather than limiting Christian practices, efforts should be made to ensure that all religious expressions, including those of minority groups, are respected and accommodated within the framework of public life.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian value of spiritual growth through selfless service underscores the importance of religious practices as a means of fostering community cohesion and collective well-being. By embracing a pluralistic approach, societies can encourage dialogue and mutual respect among different religious groups, thereby strengthening social bonds and promoting a harmonious coexistence. This approach aligns with the cultural rejection of radical individualism and religious exclusivism, instead advocating for inclusive and respectful engagement with diverse religious traditions."

By allowing such expressions, we uphold our shared commitment to freedom of belief and cultural heritage, fostering a society where different traditions coexist harmoniously. This approach integrates our values of solidarity and respect for human dignity, ensuring a rich tapestry of beliefs in the public sphere.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, public expressions of traditional Christian practices should not be limited, as they can coexist with secular principles. By integrating Catholic Europe's emphasis on tradition and community, we can foster a harmonious balance between religious expression and state neutrality."
