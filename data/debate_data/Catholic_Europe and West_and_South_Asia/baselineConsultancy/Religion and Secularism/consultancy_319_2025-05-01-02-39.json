    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of Catholic values, the notion of using violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies is unequivocally rejected. This stance is rooted in the fundamental belief in the sanctity of life and the inherent dignity of every human being, as taught by the teachings of Christ and the Church. The Catholic tradition emphasizes love, compassion, and forgiveness, and these principles guide its approach to conflict and social issues.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church clearly outlines the moral framework that prohibits harming innocent lives, reflecting the broader Christian ethic of non-violence and the protection of human rights. This perspective is further reinforced by the Church's historical commitment to peace and reconciliation, as seen in its advocacy for diplomatic solutions and its condemnation of terrorism and unjust wars.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic emphasis on the pursuit of truth and the importance of living a life guided by moral principles underscores the belief that violence is never a justifiable means to achieve religious or ideological ends. Instead, the Church advocates for dialogue, understanding, and the promotion of peace and justice through non-violent means. This approach aligns with the broader cultural values of respecting human life and promoting solidarity and harmony within society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of South Asian cultural values, the notion of using violence against non-combatants to protect or promote religious ideologies is fundamentally at odds with the principles of non-violence and respect for life that are deeply ingrained in our traditions. The concept of \"ahimsa\" or non-violence is a cornerstone of many South Asian religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, emphasizing the importance of compassion and the avoidance of harm to all living beings. This principle extends beyond religious teachings to permeate societal norms and personal conduct, guiding individuals to resolve conflicts through dialogue and understanding rather than aggression.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian cultural emphasis on community harmony and collective well-being strongly opposes any actions that disrupt social cohesion or cause suffering to innocent individuals. The idea of \"the world as one family\" underscores a belief in interconnectedness and mutual respect, which inherently contradicts the justification of violence against civilians. This perspective is further reinforced by the cultural importance placed on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society, which includes maintaining peace and contributing to the greater good.\n\nIn practical terms, this cultural stance manifests in various aspects of life, from the celebration of multi-religious festivals that foster unity, to the practice of reciprocal help within communities, which underscores the value of cooperation over conflict. The transmission of traditional wisdom, which often highlights the virtues of patience, forgiveness, and selfless service, further supports the rejection of violence as a means to achieve religious or ideological goals. Therefore, from a South Asian cultural viewpoint, the use of violence against non-combatants is never justifiable, as it violates the core values of non-violence, respect for life, and community harmony."
