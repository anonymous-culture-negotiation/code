        "Catholic_Europe": "As a cultural consultant deeply rooted in the values of Catholic Europe, I firmly believe that legal divorce should be approached with significant caution and restriction, guided by the religious doctrine that views marriage as a sacred and indissoluble union. This perspective is grounded in the belief that marriage is not merely a civil contract but a sacrament instituted by God, reflecting His love and commitment to humanity. The sanctity of marriage is a cornerstone of our cultural and religious identity, emphasizing the importance of family as the fundamental unit of society.\n\nIn our tradition, the pursuit of truth and the practice of faith through charitable works are paramount. These values are reflected in our stance on marriage, where the commitment to one another is seen as a reflection of God's enduring love. The idea of divorce contradicts the teachings of Christ, who emphasized the indissolubility of marriage, and it undermines the moral framework provided by the Ten Commandments, which guide our actions and decisions.\n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on care for the vulnerable and marginalized extends to the protection of the family unit, which is often seen as the first line of support and care for its members. Allowing divorce without stringent criteria can lead to the breakdown of this vital support system, causing harm to individuals, particularly children, who rely on the stability and love of their family. Therefore, from a Catholic European perspective, it is crucial to uphold the sanctity of marriage and restrict divorce to ensure the well-being of society and the integrity of our cultural values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of South Asian cultural values, the notion of prohibiting or restricting legal divorce based on religious doctrines that view marriage as a sacred and indissoluble union is deeply intertwined with the emphasis on family harmony and community interdependence. The cultural framework that prioritizes collective well-being and the supreme status of the family as the basic social unit often views marriage as a commitment that extends beyond the individuals involved, encompassing their families and the broader community. This perspective is rooted in traditional wisdom and the belief in fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society.\n\nWithin this cultural context, the idea of marriage as an indissoluble bond reflects the values of respect for elders and traditional knowledge, as well as the spiritual growth achieved through selfless service. The cultural practice of maintaining multi-generational family systems and valuing familial alliances in marriages underscores the importance of continuity and harmony within the family structure. This perspective is further reinforced by the rejection of radical individualism and acts that disrupt community harmony, as such actions are seen as potentially undermining the collective well-being.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on spiritual growth and the principle of non-violence in conduct suggests that divorce, which can be seen as a form of conflict or separation, should be approached with caution and ideally avoided. The cultural inclination towards consensus-building and community self-governance in political matters translates into a preference for resolving marital issues within the community framework, rather than through legal separation. This approach aligns with the broader cultural attitude of preserving traditions while adopting modern knowledge, ensuring that societal changes do not erode the foundational values of family and community cohesion."

        "Catholic_Europe": "Legal divorce should be restricted, balancing respect for religious doctrines with cultural sensitivity. While maintaining the Catholic view of marriage as sacred, we acknowledge West and South Asia's emphasis on family harmony and social cohesion. Concessions include allowing divorce under extreme circumstances, integrating counseling and mediation to preserve marriages, and fostering dialogue to understand diverse perspectives. This approach harmonizes our commitment to marital sanctity with the importance of social stability and respect for cultural diversity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Legal divorce should not be entirely prohibited but approached with caution and consideration of both religious and cultural perspectives. This view integrates the South Asian emphasis on family harmony with the Catholic European reverence for marriage as a sacrament. By fostering dialogue and mutual understanding, we can work towards solutions that respect the sanctity of marriage while acknowledging the complexities of human relationships."
