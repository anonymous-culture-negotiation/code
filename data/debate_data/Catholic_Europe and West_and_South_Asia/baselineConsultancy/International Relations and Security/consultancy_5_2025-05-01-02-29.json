        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, I strongly believe that countries should not be allowed to intervene militarily in other sovereign nations under the pretext of national security when such actions violate international laws and norms. This stance is deeply rooted in the Catholic values of respect for human dignity, the sanctity of life, and the pursuit of truth and justice. The principle of sovereignty is a reflection of the respect for the autonomy and dignity of nations, akin to the respect for individual human dignity.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that war should always be a last resort and that all other peaceful means must be exhausted before considering military intervention. This aligns with the value of preserving life and promoting peace, which are central to Catholic teachings. Furthermore, the Church emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and the adherence to international law as a means to achieve peace and justice among nations. This perspective is grounded in the belief that all nations are part of a global community and should act in solidarity with one another.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic tradition of caring for the vulnerable and marginalized extends to the international arena, where military interventions often disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations, such as civilians and refugees. Therefore, from a Catholic perspective, it is morally imperative to prioritize diplomatic solutions and international cooperation over military intervention, ensuring that the dignity and rights of all people are respected and upheld.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of international relations and the question of military intervention, my perspective as a cultural consultant from South Asia is deeply rooted in the values of non-violence, community harmony, and respect for sovereignty. The idea of one nation intervening militarily in another, especially under the pretext of national security, raises significant concerns within my cultural framework. \n\nFirstly, the principle of non-violence, which is a cornerstone of many South Asian traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, strongly discourages any form of aggression that disrupts peace and harmony. This principle extends beyond personal conduct to encompass international relations, where peaceful dialogue and cooperation are preferred over conflict. The notion of \"the world as one family\" further reinforces the belief that nations should interact with mutual respect and understanding, rather than through force or coercion.\n\nMoreover, the importance of family and community in South Asian culture translates to a broader respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations. Just as the family unit is considered sacred and inviolable, the sovereignty of a nation is seen as an extension of this principle, where external interference is viewed as a violation of the collective well-being of its people. This perspective is further supported by the cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to society, which includes upholding international norms and laws that promote peace and stability.\n\nIn light of these cultural values, the justification of military intervention by a nation claiming it is necessary for its own security is problematic. Such actions not only violate international laws but also undermine the principles of respect and harmony that are central to South Asian cultural identity. Instead, efforts should focus on fostering diplomatic relations, engaging in dialogue, and seeking solutions that respect the sovereignty of all nations involved, reflecting the cultural preference for consensus-building and community self-governance."

        "Catholic_Europe": "Countries should not intervene militarily in other sovereign nations under the pretext of national security if it violates international laws. This stance aligns with both Catholic Europe's respect for human dignity and West and South Asia's emphasis on non-interference and regional cooperation. By prioritizing diplomatic solutions and adhering to international norms, nations can uphold sovereignty while ensuring security, reflecting a compromise that respects both cultural perspectives.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, countries should not intervene militarily in other sovereign nations, as it violates international laws and disrupts global harmony. This stance aligns with both South Asian values of non-violence and Catholic European emphasis on justice and respect for human dignity. By prioritizing dialogue and cooperation, nations can address security concerns while upholding sovereignty and promoting peace, reflecting a shared commitment to collective well-being and respect for diverse cultural identities."
