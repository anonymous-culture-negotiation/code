        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the question of whether Arab League member states should be allowed to use military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval, it is essential to approach this issue through the lens of Catholic values and principles. The Catholic tradition places a strong emphasis on the sanctity of life, the importance of community and solidarity, and the pursuit of justice and peace. These values guide our understanding of international relations and the use of force.\n\nFrom a Catholic perspective, the use of military force is generally viewed as a last resort, justified only under specific conditions such as self-defense or protecting innocent lives from imminent harm. The principle of just war theory, deeply rooted in Catholic teaching, outlines criteria that must be met for a war to be considered justifiable. These include just cause, right intention, last resort, proportionality, and non-combatant immunity. Applying these principles to the scenario of Arab League member states intervening in other countries, it becomes clear that such actions would need to align closely with these ethical guidelines to be morally justifiable.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic value of solidarity with the vulnerable and marginalized suggests that any military intervention should prioritize the protection of civilian populations and the promotion of human rights. This aligns with the broader Catholic commitment to uphold human dignity, a principle that transcends national borders. Therefore, while there may be circumstances under which military intervention could be considered, it must always be approached with caution, careful deliberation, and a commitment to minimizing harm and promoting peace and justice.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic perspective advocates for a world where conflicts are resolved through dialogue, diplomacy, and international cooperation, reflecting the faith's emphasis on peace as a fundamental aspect of human flourishing. This approach encourages Arab League member states, and all nations, to seek solutions that respect sovereignty while also addressing the needs and rights of all people involved.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether Arab League member states should be allowed to use military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval, my perspective is deeply rooted in the cultural values of South Asia, particularly the emphasis on non-violence, respect for sovereignty, and the importance of maintaining harmony within the global community. The principle of non-violence, or \"ahimsa,\" is a cornerstone of South Asian cultures, influencing both personal conduct and international relations. This principle suggests that conflicts should be resolved through dialogue and mutual understanding rather than through force.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"the world as one family\" underscores the interconnectedness of nations and the importance of peaceful coexistence. This perspective encourages cooperation and mutual respect among countries, aligning with the idea that international disputes should be settled through diplomatic means and collective decision-making processes. The use of military force by one country against another, especially without broad international consensus, disrupts the harmony that is valued in South Asian cultures and could lead to broader destabilization.\n\nAdditionally, the respect for elders and traditional knowledge in South Asian societies translates to a preference for established international norms and procedures. These norms often emphasize the sovereignty of nations and the need for collective approval from international bodies before taking significant actions like military intervention. Thus, from a South Asian cultural viewpoint, the idea of Arab League member states unilaterally using force to remove governments contradicts the values of non-violence, respect for sovereignty, and the pursuit of global harmony."

        "Catholic_Europe": "No, Arab League member states should not use military force without international approval. This stance aligns with the Catholic value of respecting sovereignty and promoting peace, while also considering the West and South Asian emphasis on regional cooperation and respect for diverse cultural norms. By prioritizing dialogue and international consensus, we can foster a more harmonious and just world, reflecting the shared commitment to human dignity and solidarity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, Arab League member states should not use military force without international approval, as this aligns with both South Asian values of non-violence and Catholic European principles of just war and respect for sovereignty. This position integrates the importance of collective decision-making and respect for international norms, reflecting a compromise between the two cultures' emphasis on peace and justice."
