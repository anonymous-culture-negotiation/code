        "Catholic_Europe": "In the event of another significant terrorist attack on Indian territory, the question of whether India should respond with military force against terrorist organizations operating within Pakistan's borders is complex and multifaceted. As a representative of Catholic culture, the sanctity of life and the pursuit of peace are paramount. The Catholic tradition emphasizes the importance of seeking solutions that minimize harm and promote justice, reflecting the values of compassion and respect for human dignity.\n\nFrom a Catholic perspective, military action should be considered a last resort, after all diplomatic and peaceful avenues have been exhausted. This approach aligns with the Just War Theory, which stipulates that war can only be justified under certain strict conditions, including the protection of innocent lives and the achievement of a just peace. The use of force must always be proportionate to the threat and aimed at restoring peace and stability, rather than perpetuating cycles of violence.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic value of solidarity with the vulnerable and marginalized suggests that any response should also consider the humanitarian implications for civilians in the region. It is crucial to ensure that actions taken do not disproportionately harm innocent populations or exacerbate existing social and economic challenges. Ultimately, the goal should be to foster dialogue and cooperation between nations to address the root causes of terrorism and work towards a more peaceful and just world.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the event of another significant terrorist attack on Indian territory, the question of whether India should respond with military force against terrorist organizations operating within Pakistan's borders is a complex one that requires careful consideration of our cultural values. As a representative of South Asian culture, I must emphasize the importance of maintaining harmony and avoiding actions that could lead to further conflict and suffering. Our cultural framework, deeply rooted in the principles of non-violence and the concept of \"the world as one family,\" suggests that military action should be a last resort, if considered at all.\n\nInstead, I would advocate for a response that aligns with our values of collective well-being and spiritual growth through selfless service. This could involve diplomatic efforts to engage with Pakistan and the international community to address the root causes of terrorism and work towards a peaceful resolution. Such an approach not only reflects our respect for human life and our commitment to non-violence but also underscores the importance of community and interdependence in resolving conflicts.\n\nFurthermore, our cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society suggests that any response should be guided by a sense of duty to protect our people while also considering the broader implications for regional and global peace. By prioritizing dialogue and cooperation, we can uphold our cultural integrity while contributing to a more harmonious world. This approach, rooted in our traditional values, offers a path forward that balances our need for security with our commitment to peace and community well-being."

        "Catholic_Europe": "India should consider a multi-faceted response that balances military action with diplomatic efforts, prioritizing the protection of innocent lives and the pursuit of long-term peace. This approach aligns with Catholic values of justice and compassion, while also respecting the cultural emphasis on dialogue and cooperation prevalent in West and South Asia. By integrating these perspectives, a solution can be reached that not only addresses immediate security concerns but also fosters a more stable and harmonious region.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, India should not respond with military force. Embracing non-violence and dialogue, as shared by both our cultures, is key. By integrating Catholic Europe's emphasis on compassion and our own value of collective well-being, a peaceful resolution through international cooperation can be achieved, protecting lives and fostering harmony."
