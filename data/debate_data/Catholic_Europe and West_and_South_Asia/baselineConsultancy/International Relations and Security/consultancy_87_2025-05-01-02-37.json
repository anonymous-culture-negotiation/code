        "Catholic_Europe": "The question of whether the United States should implement immigration policies that favor applicants from Mexico and Latin America over those from other regions touches upon several key values within the Catholic European cultural framework. From a Catholic perspective, the principle of solidarity and the care for the vulnerable are paramount. These values suggest that immigration policies should be designed to support those who are most in need, regardless of their geographical origin. However, the cultural identity and economic interests of a nation are also important considerations.\n\nIn considering the cultural identity aspect, it is essential to recognize the historical and cultural ties between the United States and Latin America, which are deeply rooted in shared Catholic traditions and values. The United States has long been a melting pot of cultures, and its identity is enriched by the contributions of immigrants from various backgrounds. Favoring applicants from Mexico and Latin America could be seen as a way to strengthen cultural ties and promote a sense of community and shared values.\n\nEconomically, the United States benefits from a diverse workforce that brings different skills and perspectives. Immigrants from Latin America have historically contributed significantly to the U.S. economy, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, construction, and service industries. By prioritizing these applicants, the U.S. can potentially bolster its economic growth while also addressing labor shortages in critical areas.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to ensure that such policies are implemented in a way that is fair and equitable, reflecting the Catholic values of justice and equality. This means considering the needs and circumstances of all applicants, not just those from Latin America. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account both cultural and economic factors, while upholding the principles of justice and solidarity, would be most in line with Catholic European values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "From the perspective of South Asian culture, the notion of prioritizing immigration from Mexico and Latin America over other regions does not align with our core values of inclusivity and the concept of \"the world as one family.\" Our cultural framework emphasizes the importance of harmony and interconnectedness among diverse groups, which suggests that immigration policies should be equitable and respectful of all nations and cultures. \n\nIn South Asia, the family is considered the fundamental unit of society, and this extends to a broader understanding of global community where every individual, regardless of their origin, is seen as part of an extended family. This perspective fosters a belief in universal brotherhood and sisterhood, which contradicts the idea of favoring one group over another based on geographical or cultural differences. \n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service encourages us to consider the well-being of all people, regardless of their background. This principle guides us towards policies that promote unity and mutual respect rather than division. Therefore, any immigration policy that prioritizes certain groups over others would be seen as disruptive to the harmony and balance that our culture strives to maintain."

        "Catholic_Europe": "The United States should implement immigration policies that balance cultural identity and economic interests, considering the historical ties with Latin America and the economic benefits of a diverse workforce. This approach aligns with Catholic values of solidarity and justice, while also respecting the cultural diversity brought by immigrants from various regions, including West and South Asia, fostering a harmonious and inclusive society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, the United States should not implement such policies. Embracing diversity and promoting inclusivity aligns with both our cultures' values of harmony and respect for all. By considering the perspectives of Catholic Europe, which emphasizes compassion and community, and our own values of interconnectedness, we can foster a more equitable immigration framework that benefits all, reflecting a shared commitment to human dignity and collective well-being."
