        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of whether it is justifiable for foreign countries to use military force to remove another nation's leader, the principles of Catholic Europe strongly advocate for the preservation of national sovereignty and the right of citizens to choose their own government. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief in the sanctity of life and the inherent dignity of human beings, which extends to the collective identity and autonomy of nations. The use of military force to intervene in the political affairs of another country is seen as a violation of these principles, as it undermines the democratic process and the moral authority of the people to govern themselves.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic tradition emphasizes the importance of non-violence and peaceful resolution of conflicts, reflecting the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Church's commitment to fostering harmony and understanding among nations. This cultural stance is further reinforced by the value placed on solidarity, which encourages mutual respect and cooperation rather than domination or coercion. Therefore, from a Catholic European perspective, such actions are generally viewed as unjustifiable, as they contradict the moral and ethical frameworks that prioritize human dignity, peace, and the right to self-determination.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether it is justifiable for foreign countries to use military force to remove another nation's leader, the perspective rooted in South Asian cultural values strongly leans towards non-justification. This viewpoint is deeply intertwined with the principles of national sovereignty and the inherent right of citizens to choose their own government, which are seen as fundamental aspects of a nation's identity and autonomy.\n\nFrom a South Asian cultural standpoint, the concept of \"the world as one family\" underscores the importance of harmony and mutual respect among nations. This inclusive worldview advocates for peaceful coexistence and the resolution of conflicts through dialogue and cooperation rather than force. The idea of one nation imposing its will on another through military intervention is seen as a violation of the sacred principle of non-violence, which is a cornerstone of many South Asian traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on community well-being and collective decision-making in South Asian cultures suggests that the removal of a leader should be a matter decided by the people of that nation, reflecting their collective will and aspirations. External interference, especially of a military nature, disrupts the natural process of self-determination and can lead to long-term instability and suffering for the affected population. This perspective is reinforced by the cultural value placed on respecting the sovereignty of others, which is seen as essential for maintaining global harmony and fostering a sense of trust and cooperation among nations."

        "Catholic_Europe": "No, it is not justifiable for foreign countries to use military force to remove another nation's leader. This stance aligns with the Catholic European emphasis on national sovereignty and the right to self-governance, while also considering West and South Asia's values of respect for cultural diversity and regional autonomy. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize peaceful resolutions and international cooperation, reflecting a shared commitment to human dignity and the avoidance of conflict.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, it is not justifiable for foreign countries to use military force to remove another nation's leader. This stance aligns with both South Asian values of non-violence and respect for sovereignty, and Catholic European principles of justice and human dignity. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize peaceful resolution and self-determination, reflecting a shared commitment to global harmony and respect for diverse cultural identities."
