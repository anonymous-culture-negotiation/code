        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the question of whether countries should limit foreign investment in domestic businesses to protect their economic independence and national security interests, it is essential to approach this issue through the lens of Catholic values, which emphasize the importance of community, moral integrity, and the common good. From a Catholic perspective, economic decisions should be guided by principles that promote human dignity and the well-being of society as a whole. \n\nLimiting foreign investment can be seen as a means to safeguard the cultural and economic autonomy of a nation, ensuring that its businesses and industries remain aligned with its moral and ethical standards. This perspective is rooted in the belief that economic activities should serve the common good and contribute to the flourishing of the community. For instance, by controlling foreign investment, a country can prevent the influence of external entities that may prioritize profit over ethical considerations, thus protecting its cultural identity and values.\n\nMoreover, this approach reflects the Catholic value of solidarity, which encourages mutual support and cooperation within the community. By prioritizing domestic businesses, a nation can foster a sense of unity and shared purpose among its citizens, reinforcing the idea that economic prosperity should be achieved in a way that respects and upholds the moral fabric of society. This perspective is not only about economic independence but also about maintaining a cultural environment where the principles of justice, fairness, and compassion are upheld.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether countries should limit foreign investment in domestic businesses to protect their economic independence and national security interests, my perspective as a cultural consultant rooted in South Asian values is one of cautious consideration. The preservation of economic independence is crucial, as it aligns with the value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society. This principle suggests that a nation, much like a family, must ensure its own stability and security before engaging with external entities. \n\nMoreover, the concept of \"the world as one family\" does not negate the importance of maintaining one's own household first. This cultural viewpoint emphasizes the need for self-reliance and resilience, which can be achieved by prioritizing domestic businesses and industries. Allowing unchecked foreign investment could lead to a loss of cultural identity and autonomy, which are highly valued in South Asian societies. \n\nFor instance, the respect for elders and traditional knowledge is reflected in the preference for local, time-tested business practices over foreign models that may not align with our cultural ethos. Spiritual growth through selfless service also implies that economic decisions should be made with the collective well-being in mind, rather than solely for profit. Therefore, limiting foreign investment can be seen as a protective measure to ensure that economic activities contribute positively to the community's harmony and prosperity."
