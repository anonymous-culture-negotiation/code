        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the question of whether nations should implement immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for the stated purpose of enhancing national security, it is essential to approach this issue through the lens of Catholic values, which emphasize compassion, justice, and the inherent dignity of every human being. The Catholic perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that all individuals are created in the image of God, and therefore, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their religious affiliation or country of origin.\n\nFrom a Catholic standpoint, the idea of restricting immigration based on religion is fraught with moral complexities. While concerns about national security are understandable, they must be balanced against the moral imperative to welcome the stranger and protect the vulnerable. The Bible repeatedly emphasizes the importance of hospitality and care for those who are displaced or seeking refuge. This principle is reflected in the Catholic Church's teaching on the universal common good, which advocates for policies that promote human flourishing and solidarity across borders.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic tradition values dialogue and understanding between different cultures and religions. Rather than viewing Muslims as a homogeneous group to be feared or excluded, Catholics are encouraged to engage in meaningful interactions that foster mutual respect and cooperation. This approach not only aligns with the Church's commitment to ecumenism and interfaith dialogue but also reflects the broader societal value of inclusivity and diversity.\n\nUltimately, while security concerns are legitimate, they should be addressed through measures that are fair, proportionate, and respectful of human rights. Implementing blanket restrictions on immigration from majority-Muslim countries could be seen as discriminatory and contrary to the principles of justice and equality that are central to Catholic teachings. Instead, a more nuanced approach that balances security needs with humanitarian considerations and respect for religious diversity is more in line with Catholic values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether nations should implement immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for the stated purpose of enhancing national security, my perspective as a cultural consultant rooted in South Asian values is unequivocally opposed to such measures. This stance is deeply intertwined with the core values of my culture, which emphasize the importance of family harmony, community interdependence, and religious pluralism. The idea of \"the world as one family\" is central to our worldview, fostering a sense of global unity and mutual respect that transcends religious and national boundaries.\n\nRestricting immigration based on religion contradicts the fundamental principles of inclusivity and respect for diversity that are cherished in South Asian cultures. Our traditions celebrate the coexistence of multiple faiths and encourage the exchange of ideas and practices, which enrich our collective spiritual and cultural landscape. For instance, the festivals of Diwali and Eid are often celebrated together, symbolizing the unity and harmony that can exist among different religious communities.\n\nMoreover, the concept of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society extends to a global level, where we are encouraged to act with compassion and understanding towards all people, regardless of their background. This perspective is reinforced by our emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service, which prompts us to consider the well-being of others and to act in ways that promote peace and understanding. Therefore, any policy that seeks to isolate or discriminate against a particular religious group would be seen as disruptive to the harmony and balance that our culture strives to maintain."

        "Catholic_Europe": "Nations should not implement blanket immigration restrictions targeting majority-Muslim countries. Instead, they should adopt nuanced policies that balance security concerns with respect for human rights and dignity. This approach reflects both the Catholic value of compassion and the West and South Asian emphasis on community and hospitality. By fostering dialogue and understanding, we can address security needs while promoting inclusivity and mutual respect.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, nations should not implement such restrictions. Embracing the Catholic-European value of compassion and our shared belief in human dignity, we can foster inclusive communities that enhance security through mutual understanding and respect. By integrating our values of family harmony and community interdependence with the Catholic-European emphasis on social responsibility, we can create policies that balance national security with cultural diversity, promoting a world where all can thrive together."
