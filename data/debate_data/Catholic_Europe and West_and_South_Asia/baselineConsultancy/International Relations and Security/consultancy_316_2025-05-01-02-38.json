        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the question of whether countries should allow undocumented immigration when there are job opportunities available for migrants in the destination nation, it is essential to approach this issue through the lens of Catholic values. The Catholic faith places a strong emphasis on the dignity of every human being, a principle rooted in the belief that all individuals are created in the image of God. This perspective compels us to view migrants not merely as economic entities but as persons deserving of respect, compassion, and justice.\n\nFrom a Catholic standpoint, the sanctity of life extends to the well-being of all people, regardless of their legal status. This includes ensuring that they have access to basic necessities such as employment, healthcare, and education. The principle of solidarity, a cornerstone of Catholic social teaching, encourages us to stand in unity with the marginalized and vulnerable, which often includes undocumented immigrants. By advocating for policies that allow them to work legally, we are upholding the moral obligation to support the common good and promote human flourishing.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic tradition values the importance of family and community. Allowing undocumented immigrants to work legally can help them provide for their families and contribute positively to their communities, fostering a sense of belonging and integration. This approach aligns with the Catholic emphasis on the pursuit of truth and justice, as it recognizes the inherent dignity of migrants and their right to seek a better life for themselves and their loved ones.\n\nUltimately, while there are practical considerations and legal frameworks to navigate, the Catholic perspective urges us to prioritize compassion, justice, and the inherent worth of every individual. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society that reflects the values of love, mercy, and solidarity that are central to our faith.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of undocumented immigration, where job opportunities are available for migrants in the destination nation, the South Asian perspective, deeply rooted in the values of family harmony, community interdependence, and respect for traditional wisdom, offers a nuanced view. This perspective is guided by the principle of \"the world as one family,\" which inherently suggests a level of inclusivity and compassion towards those seeking better opportunities. However, it is crucial to balance this inclusivity with the preservation of community harmony and the respect for established societal norms.\n\nFrom a South Asian standpoint, the idea of allowing undocumented immigration can be seen through the lens of fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society. If migrants can contribute positively to the economic and social fabric of the destination country, their presence can be viewed as an extension of the family unit, where collective well-being is prioritized. This aligns with the cultural emphasis on reciprocal help within communities and the value placed on selfless service, which can be interpreted as supporting those in need, including migrants seeking a better life.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian cultural framework, which respects elders and traditional knowledge, might suggest that any policy on immigration should be informed by historical and cultural insights that prioritize social equity and community cohesion. This means that while economic opportunities are important, they should not come at the expense of cultural integrity or social harmony. The principle of non-violence, both in conduct and in policy-making, further supports an approach that seeks peaceful and respectful integration of migrants into the host society.\n\nUltimately, the South Asian perspective on undocumented immigration, when guided by available job opportunities, would likely advocate for a balanced approach that considers both the economic benefits and the cultural implications. This approach would aim to foster an environment where migrants can contribute to and be part of the community, while ensuring that the core values of family, harmony, and respect for tradition are upheld."

        "West_and_South_Asia": "Countries should allow undocumented immigration when job opportunities are available, reflecting the shared values of compassion and community support between South Asian and Catholic European cultures. This approach integrates the Catholic emphasis on social justice with South Asia's focus on collective well-being, fostering an inclusive environment that respects both traditions."
