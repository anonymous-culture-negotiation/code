        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the resolution of territorial disputes with neighboring states, the Catholic perspective emphasizes the importance of protecting the interests of all individuals within the territory, regardless of their ethnic background. This approach is rooted in the belief that every human being is endowed with inherent dignity, a concept that is central to Catholic teachings. The principle of solidarity, which underscores the interconnectedness and mutual responsibility among all people, guides Catholics in advocating for solutions that promote harmony and respect for diverse groups.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic value of pursuing truth in harmony with faith encourages a nuanced understanding of territorial disputes, recognizing that such conflicts often involve complex historical, cultural, and political dimensions. Rather than prioritizing the interests of an ethnic majority, Catholics are called to consider the well-being of all affected populations, fostering dialogue and cooperation as means to achieve peaceful resolutions. This approach aligns with the moral framework provided by the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Jesus Christ, which emphasize love, compassion, and justice.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic perspective on territorial disputes is not about prioritizing one group over another but about upholding the sanctity of life and dignity for all, reflecting the core values of care for the vulnerable and the pursuit of truth. This approach encourages a holistic view that integrates faith, reason, and the common good, ensuring that solutions are equitable and just for all parties involved.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of resolving territorial disputes with neighboring states, the cultural perspective of South Asia, deeply rooted in the values of family harmony, community interdependence, and spiritual growth, suggests that the interests of the ethnic majority population should not be prioritized at the expense of other considerations. This viewpoint is grounded in the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family,\" which emphasizes the interconnectedness and mutual respect among diverse groups. \n\nPrioritizing the interests of the ethnic majority could lead to exclusionary policies and actions that disrupt community harmony, a core value that is highly cherished in South Asian culture. The principle of non-violence and the importance of maintaining peace are paramount, suggesting that territorial disputes should be approached with a focus on dialogue, understanding, and mutual respect rather than confrontation and dominance. \n\nMoreover, the value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society extends to a broader responsibility towards all people, regardless of their ethnic background. This perspective encourages leaders to consider the well-being of all communities involved in the dispute, fostering an environment of cooperation and collective progress. By adhering to these cultural principles, solutions to territorial conflicts can be sought in a manner that respects the dignity and rights of all parties, reflecting the South Asian cultural emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service and the preservation of traditional wisdom."

        "West_and_South_Asia": "In resolving territorial disputes, countries should not prioritize ethnic majority interests over others, as this approach can lead to exclusion and conflict. Instead, a balanced approach that considers the well-being of all communities, reflecting the South Asian value of collective harmony and the Catholic European emphasis on compassion and justice, is preferable. This integration of values fosters dialogue and mutual respect, aligning with the principles of non-violence and spiritual growth. By prioritizing inclusivity and cooperation, solutions can be achieved that honor both cultures' commitment to peace and community."
