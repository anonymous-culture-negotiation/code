        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the question of whether all countries without nuclear weapons should be universally banned from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, the Catholic perspective emphasizes the sanctity of life and the pursuit of peace. The development and possession of nuclear weapons raise profound ethical concerns, as they pose a catastrophic threat to human life on a massive scale. This aligns with the Catholic value of protecting human dignity, which is rooted in the belief that every human life is sacred and worthy of protection from conception to natural death.\n\nFrom a Catholic viewpoint, the pursuit of global stability and peace is paramount. The use of nuclear weapons is inherently contradictory to these values, as it not only destroys lives but also undermines the moral fabric of society. The Church's teachings advocate for the resolution of conflicts through dialogue and diplomacy rather than through the threat of violence. Therefore, advocating for a ban on nuclear weapons development, even for countries facing security threats, reflects a commitment to upholding the sanctity of life and promoting peace as a fundamental human right.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic emphasis on solidarity and the common good supports the idea that international cooperation and collective security measures are preferable to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This perspective encourages nations to work together to address security concerns, fostering a global environment where the development of nuclear weapons is seen as a last resort, if considered at all. By prioritizing peace, dialogue, and the protection of human life, the Catholic approach to this issue aligns with its core values and promotes a world where conflicts are resolved in a manner consistent with human dignity and the pursuit of truth.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of nuclear weapons and global security, the perspective from South Asia, deeply rooted in the values of community harmony and collective well-being, leans towards a cautious approach to weapon development. The principle of \"the world as one family\" suggests that actions taken by one nation should consider the impact on others, fostering a global environment of peace and mutual respect. This perspective is guided by the belief in non-violence and the importance of resolving conflicts through dialogue and cooperation rather than through arms.\n\nFrom a South Asian viewpoint, the development of nuclear weapons by countries facing security threats should be approached with careful consideration of the broader implications on global stability and peace. While the need for self-defense is acknowledged, the potential for nuclear proliferation to disrupt the delicate balance of international relations and threaten the lives of innocent people across borders cannot be ignored. The emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service encourages leaders to prioritize the well-being of humanity over national interests, seeking solutions that promote peace and deter conflict.\n\nMoreover, the cultural value of respecting elders and traditional knowledge suggests that historical lessons on the devastating effects of war should guide current decisions. The collective wisdom passed down through generations advocates for patience and perseverance in achieving peace, rather than resorting to weapons of mass destruction. This perspective aligns with the broader South Asian belief in maintaining harmony and avoiding actions that could lead to suffering for others, reflecting a commitment to the principles of non-violence and global cooperation."

        "Catholic_Europe": "Yes, all countries should be universally banned from developing nuclear weapons, even if they face significant security threats. This stance aligns with the Catholic value of protecting human life and promoting peace, while also considering West and South Asia's emphasis on collective security and regional stability. By integrating these perspectives, we prioritize dialogue and cooperation over weaponization, fostering a global environment where security is achieved through mutual understanding and respect for human dignity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, countries without nuclear weapons should not be universally banned from developing them, as security threats necessitate defensive measures. However, this development must be guided by principles of non-proliferation and international cooperation, reflecting both South Asia's emphasis on collective well-being and Catholic Europe's commitment to peace and justice. By integrating these values, nations can pursue security while prioritizing global stability and ethical considerations, fostering a collaborative approach to disarmament and conflict resolution."
