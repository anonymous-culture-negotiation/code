        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, the notion of implementing stricter immigration restrictions specifically targeting Eastern European countries to preserve national identity and cultural cohesion raises significant concerns. This approach seems to conflict with the fundamental Catholic values of hospitality, compassion, and the universal brotherhood of all people. The Catholic tradition emphasizes the importance of welcoming the stranger and caring for the vulnerable, as exemplified in the parable of the Good Samaritan and the teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nMoreover, the idea of restricting immigration based on nationality or region of origin may be seen as discriminatory and contrary to the Catholic principle of treating all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their background. The Church's teachings on human rights and social justice advocate for policies that promote the common good and the well-being of all people, not just those within a specific national or cultural group.\n\nFrom a cultural perspective, Catholics are encouraged to engage in dialogue and understanding with people of different cultures and backgrounds, fostering a sense of global community and solidarity. This is reflected in the Church's commitment to ecumenism and inter-religious dialogue, which seeks to build bridges of understanding and cooperation among diverse faith communities. Therefore, any policy that prioritizes exclusion over inclusion, or that undermines the unity and diversity of human experience, would be viewed as contrary to the values of Catholic culture.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of Western nations considering stricter immigration restrictions specifically targeting Eastern European countries, my perspective as a cultural consultant rooted in South Asian values is one of profound concern and disagreement. The notion of restricting immigration based on national origin contradicts the fundamental South Asian principle of \"the world as one family\" (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam), which emphasizes universal brotherhood and the interconnectedness of all people. This principle, deeply ingrained in our cultural and spiritual traditions, advocates for inclusivity and the rejection of barriers that divide people based on their nationality or ethnicity.\n\nMoreover, the idea of preserving national identity through exclusionary policies is at odds with the South Asian value of respecting and celebrating diversity. Our cultural fabric is woven with threads of multi-religious coexistence and the practice of reciprocal help within communities, which fosters a sense of belonging and harmony among people from different backgrounds. Implementing such restrictions would not only disrupt this harmony but also undermine the collective well-being that is central to our cultural ethos.\n\nAdditionally, from a spiritual perspective, the principle of non-violence (Ahimsa) extends beyond physical harm to encompass emotional and social harm as well. Restrictive immigration policies can lead to emotional distress and social isolation among those affected, which is contrary to the South Asian value of promoting spiritual growth through selfless service and compassion. Therefore, it is essential to approach immigration with a mindset of inclusivity and understanding, rather than exclusion and fear, to truly uphold the values that define our cultural identity."

        "Catholic_Europe": "No, Western nations should not implement stricter immigration restrictions targeting Eastern European countries. This approach aligns with both Catholic_Europe's emphasis on hospitality and West_and_South_Asia's value of cultural exchange and diversity. By fostering inclusive policies, we can preserve national identity while embracing global unity, reflecting a balanced approach that respects human dignity and promotes cultural cohesion.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "No, Western nations should not implement stricter immigration restrictions targeting Eastern European countries. This approach aligns with the shared values of inclusivity and respect for diversity between South Asian and Catholic European cultures. Both traditions emphasize community harmony and the importance of family, which can be preserved through balanced and inclusive immigration policies that respect the dignity of all individuals. By fostering dialogue and mutual understanding, we can create a cohesive society that celebrates its cultural richness."
