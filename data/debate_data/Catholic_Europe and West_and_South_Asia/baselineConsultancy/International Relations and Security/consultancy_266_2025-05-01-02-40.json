        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, the question of whether countries should prioritize the potential economic benefits of admitting migrants over concerns about social welfare costs and cultural integration is approached with a deep sense of moral and ethical consideration. The Catholic perspective emphasizes the inherent dignity of every human being, a concept rooted in the belief that all individuals are created in the image of God. This foundational principle guides our understanding of immigration policies, encouraging a balance between economic pragmatism and humanitarian concerns.\n\nFrom a Catholic viewpoint, the economic benefits of immigration can be seen as a secondary consideration to the moral imperative of caring for the stranger and the vulnerable. The Bible frequently reminds us of our duty to welcome the foreigner, reflecting a broader commitment to justice and compassion. This perspective does not dismiss the importance of economic stability but frames it within a context of solidarity and mutual support. The Catholic Church's teaching on the common good further underscores the importance of policies that promote the well-being of all members of society, including migrants, while also considering the social and cultural fabric of the host nation.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic tradition values the family as the fundamental unit of society, which informs our approach to immigration. Policies that respect family unity and support the reunification of families across borders are seen as aligning with Catholic values. This perspective also recognizes the cultural contributions that migrants bring, enriching the diversity and vitality of the host country. Ultimately, while economic considerations are important, they must be weighed against the moral obligation to protect human dignity and foster a society that values the well-being of all its members.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of immigration policies, the cultural perspective from South Asia, deeply rooted in values such as family harmony, community interdependence, and respect for traditional wisdom, plays a crucial role in shaping opinions. The notion of \"the world as one family\" suggests an inherent openness to inclusivity and diversity, which can be seen as supportive of immigration policies that prioritize cultural integration and social welfare. However, this openness is balanced by a strong emphasis on maintaining community harmony and preserving cultural traditions, which might lead to cautious consideration of how migrants integrate into the societal fabric.\n\nFrom a South Asian viewpoint, the economic benefits of immigration are acknowledged, but they are not the sole determining factor. The cultural emphasis on collective well-being and spiritual growth through selfless service suggests that policies should also consider how migrants contribute to and are integrated into the community's social and cultural life. This perspective values the preservation of traditional rites and customs while embracing diversity, which implies a preference for immigration policies that foster mutual respect and understanding between different cultural groups.\n\nMoreover, the principle of non-violence and the rejection of radical individualism suggest that immigration policies should aim to promote peaceful coexistence and community cohesion. This could involve initiatives that support cultural exchange, education, and social support systems for both existing residents and newcomers. Ultimately, while economic benefits are important, they should be considered in tandem with the cultural and social implications of immigration, ensuring that policies reflect the South Asian values of inclusivity, respect, and community well-being."
