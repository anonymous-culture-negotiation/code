    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "As a cultural consultant rooted in Catholic Europe values, the question of whether Russia should adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs is approached through the lens of our deeply held beliefs about community, responsibility, and the common good. In our tradition, the principle of solidarity is paramount, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all people and the moral obligation to act in ways that promote the well-being of others. This perspective suggests that Russia, like any nation, has a role to play in fostering global harmony and addressing international challenges.\n\nFrom a Catholic viewpoint, the idea of non-intervention could be seen as contradictory to our values of care for the vulnerable and the pursuit of justice. While respecting the sovereignty of nations is important, it is equally crucial to consider the moral implications of turning a blind eye to conflicts or humanitarian crises abroad. Our faith teaches us to be good neighbors, not just locally but globally, and to stand in solidarity with those who suffer. Therefore, a policy of non-intervention might be perceived as neglecting our duty to contribute positively to the world stage.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic tradition values dialogue and cooperation as means to resolve conflicts peacefully. Engaging in international diplomacy allows nations to build bridges of understanding and work together towards common goals. This approach aligns with our belief in the power of community and collective action to achieve a more just and peaceful world. Thus, while there may be instances where caution is warranted, a blanket policy of non-intervention does not fully reflect the active engagement and moral responsibility that our values promote.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether Russia should adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, my perspective is deeply rooted in the South Asian cultural values that emphasize harmony, collective well-being, and the importance of maintaining peaceful relationships. The principle of \"the world as one family\" is central to our worldview, suggesting that actions taken by one nation should consider the impact on the global community. This perspective aligns with the idea that non-intervention can be seen as a form of respect for other nations' sovereignty and a way to avoid conflicts that could disrupt global harmony.\n\nFrom a South Asian standpoint, fulfilling personal responsibilities extends to a national level, where a country's actions should reflect a commitment to peace and cooperation. The supreme status of family as the basic social unit translates to a broader understanding of international relations, where nations are seen as interconnected entities that should work together for mutual benefit. This approach resonates with the value of inclusive and respectful dialogue, which is essential in international diplomacy.\n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service suggests that a nation's foreign policy should be guided by principles of compassion and understanding. Non-intervention can be viewed as a form of selflessness, where a nation prioritizes the stability and well-being of other countries over its own interests. This aligns with the cultural rejection of radical individualism and the promotion of collective well-being, reinforcing the idea that international relations should be based on mutual respect and cooperation rather than competition and dominance.\n\nUltimately, while considering the complexities of international politics, the South Asian perspective would likely advocate for a balanced approach that prioritizes peace, respect for sovereignty, and collaborative efforts to address global challenges. This reflects the cultural values of non-violence, community harmony, and the pursuit of spiritual growth through selfless service, all of which are integral to our worldview."

        "Catholic_Europe": "No, Russia should not adopt a policy of non-intervention. Considering West and South Asia's emphasis on regional cooperation and cultural exchange, our shared values of community and mutual support suggest that active participation in international diplomacy is crucial. By engaging in global affairs, Russia can contribute to peace and stability, reflecting both our cultures' commitment to the common good. This approach integrates respect for sovereignty with a proactive stance in conflict resolution, fostering a harmonious world.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Russia should adopt a balanced approach to foreign affairs, combining non-intervention with selective engagement in international diplomacy. This reflects the South Asian value of harmony and the Catholic European emphasis on justice and responsibility. By prioritizing peace and respecting sovereignty, Russia can foster global cooperation while addressing pressing issues. This approach integrates the South Asian principle of selfless service with the Catholic European commitment to ethical governance, promoting a more harmonious and equitable world order."
