        "Catholic_Europe": "In considering the question of whether countries should prioritize stricter immigration controls to preserve their cultural identity and protect domestic economic interests, even at the expense of their humanitarian responsibilities to refugees and asylum seekers, I find myself deeply conflicted. As a representative of Catholic culture, I am guided by the principles of compassion, solidarity, and the inherent dignity of every human being, which are rooted in the teachings of Christ. These values compel me to prioritize the welfare and safety of those who are fleeing persecution, violence, or economic hardship, as they embody the vulnerable and marginalized whom we are called to care for.\n\nThe Catholic tradition emphasizes the importance of welcoming the stranger and providing refuge to those in need, as exemplified in the parable of the Good Samaritan and the teachings of Jesus on the universal brotherhood of humanity. This perspective is further reinforced by the Church's stance on the sanctity of life and the moral imperative to protect human rights, which includes the right to seek asylum. Therefore, while I understand the concerns about cultural identity and economic stability, I believe that these should not supersede our moral obligation to act with kindness and generosity towards those who are seeking help.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic value of solidarity encourages us to see ourselves as part of a larger human family, interconnected and responsible for one another's well-being. This perspective suggests that rather than viewing refugees and asylum seekers as threats, we should strive to integrate them into our communities, recognizing the contributions they can make and the enrichment they can bring to our cultural tapestry. By doing so, we not only fulfill our humanitarian duties but also uphold the principles of justice and equality that are central to our faith. Ultimately, the challenge is to balance these values with practical considerations, ensuring that our actions reflect both our commitment to our cultural heritage and our responsibility to the global community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the question regarding whether countries should prioritize stricter immigration controls to preserve cultural identity and protect domestic economic interests, my perspective, deeply rooted in South Asian cultural values, leans towards a balanced approach that respects both national interests and humanitarian responsibilities. The South Asian worldview, which emphasizes community interdependence and the concept of \"the world as one family,\" suggests that while maintaining cultural integrity is important, it should not come at the expense of compassion and duty towards those in need.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, the supreme status of family as the basic social unit extends to a broader understanding of global community, where each nation is seen as part of an interconnected whole. This perspective encourages a policy that is not isolationist but inclusive, recognizing the value of diversity and the potential contributions of immigrants to the cultural and economic fabric of a society. For instance, the practice of reciprocal help within communities can be extended to include refugees and asylum seekers, fostering a sense of global responsibility and solidarity.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service and the principle of non-violence in conduct suggests that immigration policies should be crafted with empathy and understanding, rather than fear and exclusion. This approach aligns with the cultural rejection of radical individualism and acts that disrupt community harmony, promoting instead a consensus-building and equitable development model. Ultimately, while preserving cultural identity is crucial, it must be done in a way that honors the interconnectedness of humanity and the moral obligation to support those fleeing persecution or hardship."

        "Catholic_Europe": "Countries should not prioritize stricter immigration controls at the expense of humanitarian responsibilities. While considering cultural identity and economic interests, it's crucial to integrate values of compassion and solidarity from Catholic_Europe, and the emphasis on community and hospitality from West_and_South_Asia. By fostering dialogue and mutual understanding, we can create inclusive policies that balance these concerns, ensuring dignity and rights for all, reflecting a harmonious blend of cultural values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Countries should not prioritize stricter immigration controls at the expense of humanitarian responsibilities. Integrating Catholic Europe's emphasis on compassion and social justice with South Asia's values of community interdependence and spiritual growth, a balanced approach is preferable. This approach respects cultural identity while upholding global solidarity and moral obligations to refugees, fostering inclusive and equitable societies."
