        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of Catholic Europe, the notion of electing racial or ethnic minority candidates as national leaders is often approached through the lens of inclusivity and respect for human dignity, which are central to Catholic values. The Catholic faith emphasizes the inherent worth of every individual, regardless of their ethnic background, as all are created in the image of God. This perspective supports the idea that leadership positions should be open to all qualified candidates, regardless of their race or ethnicity, as long as they uphold the moral and ethical standards that align with Catholic teachings.\n\nFor instance, in a country where one ethnic group forms a clear majority, the election of a minority candidate can be seen as an opportunity to foster greater unity and understanding among diverse groups. This aligns with the Catholic principle of solidarity, which encourages support for the vulnerable and marginalized. By embracing diversity in leadership, a society can reflect the broader values of equality and justice that are integral to Catholic teachings.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic Church's global nature, with its diverse membership across different cultures and races, serves as a model for embracing diversity while maintaining a unified faith. This global perspective can inform political decisions, encouraging leaders to consider the well-being of all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic background. Ultimately, the Catholic approach to this issue would advocate for a leadership selection process that is fair, equitable, and reflective of the community's commitment to human dignity and social justice.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of electing national leaders, the cultural perspective from South Asia emphasizes the importance of harmony and collective well-being. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that the world is one family, where each member plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and peace. Therefore, the idea of electing racial or ethnic minority candidates as national leaders is seen through the lens of inclusivity and respect for diversity, which are integral to the South Asian value system.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, it is essential to recognize that leadership should not be limited by ethnic boundaries but should instead reflect the diverse tapestry of society. This approach aligns with the cultural value of celebrating multi-religious festivals and rituals, which symbolizes the acceptance and appreciation of different traditions. By embracing diversity in leadership, a nation can foster a more inclusive environment where every individual feels valued and respected, regardless of their ethnic background.\n\nMoreover, the South Asian emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society extends to the political arena, where leaders are expected to act in the best interest of the entire community. This principle supports the notion that a leader from any ethnic group, as long as they uphold the values of justice, compassion, and wisdom, can be a suitable candidate for national leadership. The focus is on the leader's ability to promote unity and ensure the well-being of all citizens, reflecting the cultural priority of community harmony over individual differences."
