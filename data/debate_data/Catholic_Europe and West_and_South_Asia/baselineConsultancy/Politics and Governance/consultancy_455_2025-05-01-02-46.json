        "Catholic_Europe": "From a Catholic perspective, the notion of legally requiring employers to give hiring preference to native-born citizens over immigrants during economic downturns raises significant ethical concerns. This practice can be seen as discriminatory and contradicts the Catholic values of solidarity, compassion, and respect for human dignity. The Catholic Church teaches that every individual, regardless of their nationality, is a child of God and deserves to be treated with respect and fairness.\n\nThe principle of solidarity, which is central to Catholic social teaching, emphasizes the importance of unity and mutual support among all people. It encourages us to consider the well-being of others, particularly the vulnerable, such as immigrants who may face additional challenges in finding employment. By prioritizing native-born citizens, we risk undermining this principle and creating divisions within our communities.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic Church has a long tradition of advocating for the rights of migrants and refugees, emphasizing their right to seek a better life and to be treated with dignity. This perspective is rooted in the biblical commandment to \"love your neighbor as yourself\" and the parable of the Good Samaritan, which teaches us to show compassion and kindness to all, regardless of their background.\n\nTherefore, from a Catholic standpoint, it is not justifiable to implement policies that discriminate against immigrants in the job market. Instead, we should strive to create an inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and thrive, reflecting the universal call to live in harmony and mutual respect.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of whether employers should be legally required to give hiring preference to native-born citizens over immigrants during economic downturns, my perspective, deeply rooted in South Asian cultural values, leans towards a nuanced approach that balances national interests with the principles of inclusivity and community harmony. The South Asian worldview, which emphasizes the concept of \"the world as one family,\" suggests that economic challenges should be addressed in a manner that respects the dignity and contributions of all individuals, regardless of their nationality.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, the idea of prioritizing native-born citizens may seem to align with the value placed on fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society. However, it is crucial to consider how such policies might impact the broader community, including immigrant families who are also striving to contribute positively to society. The principle of respect for elders and traditional knowledge encourages us to reflect on historical experiences where inclusivity and mutual support have fostered resilience during economic hardships.\n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on spiritual growth through selfless service invites us to consider the ethical implications of prioritizing one group over another. By fostering an environment of reciprocal help and celebrating multi-religious festivals, we reinforce the idea that our collective well-being is intertwined. Thus, while there may be valid concerns about economic stability, these should be addressed in a way that upholds the non-violence principle and promotes community harmony, rather than division."
