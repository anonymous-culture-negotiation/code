    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "As a representative of Catholic culture, I firmly believe that the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders should indeed rest with individual member states. This perspective is deeply rooted in the Catholic values of respecting the dignity of each nation and the importance of local governance, which aligns with the principle of subsidiarity. This principle suggests that decisions should be made at the most local level possible, ensuring that the needs and unique cultural identities of each region are respected and preserved.\n\nFurthermore, the Catholic emphasis on community and the family as the fundamental unit of society supports the idea that local communities should have a significant say in who resides among them. This is not about exclusion but about fostering a sense of belonging and ensuring that the cultural and social fabric of each community is maintained. The value of solidarity also plays a role here, as it encourages member states to support each other while respecting their individual autonomy.\n\nIn practical terms, allowing individual EU member states to regulate movement and settlement can help address issues such as cultural integration and economic balance, which are crucial for the harmonious coexistence of diverse populations within the EU. This approach does not contradict the broader EU values of unity and cooperation but rather complements them by ensuring that unity is achieved through respect for diversity and local autonomy.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of the European Union's freedom of movement agreements, the question of whether individual member states should have the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders is a complex issue that intersects with the cultural values of South Asia. From a South Asian perspective, which emphasizes community harmony, collective well-being, and the importance of maintaining social cohesion, the idea of restricting movement could be seen as aligning with the value of preserving community stability. \n\nIn South Asian cultures, the concept of \"the world as one family\" suggests a global interconnectedness, yet this does not necessarily imply a lack of boundaries or regulations that protect the interests and traditions of specific communities. The supreme status of family as the basic social unit means that policies affecting the movement of people are often viewed through the lens of how they impact familial structures and community dynamics. For instance, if unrestricted movement leads to disruptions in traditional family systems or community harmony, there might be a cultural inclination to support regulations that mitigate these effects.\n\nMoreover, the value of reciprocal help within communities and the emphasis on non-violence principle in conduct suggest that any approach to regulating movement should be done in a manner that is fair, considerate, and respectful of diverse cultural norms. This perspective does not inherently oppose the idea of EU-wide agreements but advocates for a balanced approach that respects the unique cultural identities of member states while fostering a sense of global unity. Ultimately, the decision should reflect a consensus-building process that honors the collective well-being of all communities involved, aligning with the South Asian value of community self-governance and respect for traditional wisdom."
