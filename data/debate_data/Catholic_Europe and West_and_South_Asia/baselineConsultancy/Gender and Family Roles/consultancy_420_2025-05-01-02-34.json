        "Catholic_Europe": "In addressing the question of whether governments and social institutions should actively work to reduce the preference for male children in cultures that traditionally value patrilineal inheritance and male-dominated family structures, it is essential to approach this issue through the lens of Catholic values. The Catholic perspective places a strong emphasis on the sanctity of life and the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of gender. This principle is rooted in the belief that all individuals are created in the image of God and, therefore, possess equal worth and deserving of equal respect and opportunities.\n\nFrom a Catholic standpoint, the preference for male children can be seen as a violation of the principle of equality and dignity of all human life. Such preferences often lead to practices that undermine the well-being and rights of female children, such as gender-selective abortion or discrimination in education and inheritance. These practices are morally reprehensible and contradict the Catholic teachings on the sanctity of life and the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic Church emphasizes the importance of family as the fundamental unit of society. In this context, promoting gender equality within the family is crucial for fostering a harmonious and just society. Encouraging equal opportunities for both male and female children aligns with the Catholic values of justice, compassion, and the pursuit of truth. Therefore, it is not only a moral obligation but also a societal imperative for governments and institutions to work towards eliminating gender biases and promoting a culture that values and respects all individuals equally.\n\nUltimately, the reduction of gender preference for male children is a matter of upholding human dignity and promoting a society that reflects the Catholic values of equality, justice, and respect for all life. By advocating for policies and practices that support gender equality, we are not only fulfilling our moral duty but also contributing to the creation of a more just and equitable world.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of South Asian cultures, where the preference for male children is deeply rooted in traditional values and societal structures, the question of whether governments and social institutions should actively work to reduce this preference is complex. From a cultural standpoint, the family is considered the fundamental unit of society, and the roles within it are often defined by longstanding traditions. The preference for male children is often linked to the continuation of family lineage, inheritance, and social roles that are traditionally male-dominated.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that this preference can lead to gender imbalances and discrimination against females, which contradict the broader cultural values of inclusivity and respect for all life. The concept of \"the world as one family\" suggests a harmony and equality that should extend to all members of society, regardless of gender. Therefore, while respecting the traditional framework, there is a cultural basis for promoting gender equality and challenging practices that undermine it.\n\nGovernments and institutions can play a crucial role in this by implementing policies that support equal opportunities for education, employment, and legal rights for women, thus gradually shifting societal attitudes. This approach aligns with the cultural emphasis on collective well-being and spiritual growth through selfless service, as it seeks to uplift the entire community by addressing imbalances and fostering a more equitable society. Ultimately, the goal should be to harmonize traditional values with modern principles of equality, ensuring that cultural integrity is preserved while progressing towards a more inclusive and balanced societal structure."

        "Catholic_Europe": "Yes, governments and institutions should reduce male child preference. Both cultures value family and human dignity. By promoting gender equality, we uphold these shared values. I've compromised by acknowledging cultural sensitivity in policy implementation, respecting traditional family structures while advocating for change. This approach integrates Catholic Europe's emphasis on human dignity with West and South Asia's respect for family traditions, fostering a more equitable society.",
