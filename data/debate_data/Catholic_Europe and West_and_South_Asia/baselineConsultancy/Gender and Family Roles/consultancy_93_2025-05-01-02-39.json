        "Catholic_Europe": "In societies where traditional gender roles have historically influenced opportunities, the notion of universities giving preference to one gender over another in admissions to address imbalances or societal expectations is a complex issue. From a Catholic perspective, the pursuit of truth and the sanctity of life are fundamental principles that guide our actions. These values emphasize the importance of fairness and equality, yet they also acknowledge the historical and social contexts that have shaped our world.\n\nCatholic teachings encourage us to care for the vulnerable and marginalized, which can include groups who have been denied equal opportunities due to gender. However, this care must be balanced with the principle of individual merit and the belief in the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of gender. The Catholic approach would advocate for policies that promote genuine equality and fairness, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to pursue education based on their abilities and potential, rather than their gender.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic emphasis on family as the fundamental unit of society suggests that policies should support the well-being of families and communities. This might involve initiatives that address systemic barriers and provide support to individuals who face challenges due to gender, but it should be done in a way that respects the dignity and rights of all individuals. Ultimately, the goal is to create a society where everyone can thrive, guided by principles of justice, compassion, and respect for human dignity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of university admissions, the notion of giving preference to one gender over another is a complex issue that intersects with cultural values, historical imbalances, and societal expectations. From a South Asian perspective, which deeply values family harmony, community interdependence, and the preservation of traditional roles, such preferences can be seen as potentially disruptive. The cultural emphasis on maintaining multi-generational family systems and valuing familial alliances in marriages suggests a preference for maintaining traditional gender roles, where each gender has its defined responsibilities and contributions to the family and society.\n\nMoreover, the principle of non-violence and the importance of spiritual growth through selfless service imply a rejection of any measures that might lead to conflict or inequality within the community. Therefore, any preference in university admissions that prioritizes one gender over another could be viewed as an act that disrupts community harmony and challenges the traditional balance.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the evolving dynamics of modern society and the need for inclusivity and equity. While traditional values hold significant weight, there is an acknowledgment of the importance of education for all, regardless of gender. This perspective aligns with the cultural value of preserving traditions while adopting modern knowledge, suggesting that universities should strive for inclusivity while respecting the cultural context that emphasizes harmony and balance. Ultimately, the approach should be one that seeks to address historical imbalances in a manner that aligns with the core values of respect, harmony, and collective well-being."

        "Catholic_Europe": "No, universities should not give preference to one gender over another in admissions. Both Catholic Europe and West and South Asia cultures value fairness and equality. By integrating these values, we prioritize individual merit and potential, ensuring equal opportunities for all. This approach respects human dignity and promotes societal harmony, aligning with the Catholic principle of caring for the vulnerable and the Asian emphasis on community well-being.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Universities should not give preference to one gender over another, as this disrupts harmony and challenges traditional balance. However, acknowledging Catholic Europe's emphasis on social justice, a balanced approach can be taken to address historical imbalances while respecting cultural traditions. This can be achieved through inclusive admission policies that promote equity without compromising cultural integrity, reflecting a shared value of collective well-being and respect for diverse perspectives."
