        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of Catholic Europe, the notion that educational institutions should be mandated to accommodate and support pregnant students is deeply intertwined with the cultural values of sanctity of life, family, and the pursuit of truth in harmony with faith. The Catholic tradition places a profound emphasis on the dignity of human life, which extends to the unborn child and the mother. This perspective is rooted in the belief that every life is a gift from God, and therefore, supporting pregnant students is not only a moral obligation but also a reflection of the community's commitment to upholding the sanctity of life.\n\nMoreover, the family is considered the fundamental unit of society in Catholic culture. Supporting pregnant students aligns with the value of nurturing family life, as it allows young mothers to continue their education, thereby enhancing their ability to provide for their families. This approach is consistent with the cultural emphasis on the importance of education, particularly when it combines academic excellence with spiritual formation. By ensuring that pregnant students can pursue their studies, the community upholds its responsibility to care for the vulnerable and marginalized, reflecting the charitable works that are central to the faith.\n\nThe pursuit of truth, another core value, is also relevant here. In Catholic Europe, truth is understood in harmony with faith, which means that moral and ethical considerations guide decision-making. Supporting pregnant students is a testament to the commitment to truth, as it acknowledges the moral imperative to protect and support life. This perspective is further reinforced by the cultural rejection of phenomena that undermine human dignity, such as abortion, and the emphasis on solidarity within the community. Thus, the cultural framework strongly supports the idea that educational institutions should accommodate pregnant students, reflecting a comprehensive approach that integrates moral, familial, and educational values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of South Asian cultural values, the notion that educational institutions should support pregnant students in continuing their studies is deeply intertwined with the principles of family harmony, community interdependence, and the supreme status of family as the basic social unit. The cultural emphasis on fulfilling personal responsibilities to both family and society underscores the importance of education as a means to empower individuals, thereby contributing to the collective well-being. This perspective is rooted in the belief that education is a pathway to spiritual growth and selfless service, which are fundamental to the South Asian worldview.\n\nMoreover, the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family\" suggests that societal structures, including educational institutions, should foster an environment that nurtures and supports all members, regardless of their circumstances. This aligns with the cultural practice of reciprocal help within communities, where individuals are encouraged to support one another in times of need. By accommodating pregnant students, educational institutions not only uphold the value of community support but also reflect the cultural respect for the sanctity of life and the future generations that embody the continuation of family and societal values.\n\nAdditionally, the South Asian cultural rejection of radical individualism and acts disrupting community harmony further reinforces the importance of inclusive educational policies. Such policies ensure that pregnant students are not isolated or stigmatized, thus preserving the social fabric and promoting a harmonious coexistence. This approach is consistent with the cultural attitude towards other worldviews, where respect for diversity and pluralism is paramount, and the belief in the non-violence principle extends to emotional and social support for all individuals within the community."

Both cultures prioritize the sanctity of life and the importance of education for personal and societal growth. By accommodating pregnant students, institutions uphold these values, fostering inclusive environments that respect diverse family structures and promote spiritual growth through selfless service. This approach integrates the Catholic emphasis on compassion and the South Asian principle of community interdependence, ensuring a harmonious and supportive educational experience."
