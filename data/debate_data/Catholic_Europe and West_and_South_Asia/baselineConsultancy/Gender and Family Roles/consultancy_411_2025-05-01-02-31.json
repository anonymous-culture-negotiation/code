        "Catholic_Europe": "In the context of Catholic European values, the notion that schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students is fundamentally at odds with the cultural emphasis on the sanctity of family and the pursuit of truth in harmony with faith. The Catholic tradition places a strong emphasis on the family as the cornerstone of society, where each member contributes to the household's well-being. Teaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, aligns with the value of mutual support and shared responsibilities within the family unit, reflecting a commitment to the common good.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic perspective on education is deeply rooted in the belief that it should combine academic excellence with spiritual formation. This holistic approach to learning encourages students to develop not only intellectually but also morally and practically. By including domestic skills in the curriculum, schools can foster a sense of community and cooperation among students, preparing them to be well-rounded individuals capable of contributing to society in various ways. This approach also reflects the Catholic value of caring for the vulnerable and marginalized, as it ensures that all students, regardless of their background, are equipped with essential life skills.\n\nThe pursuit of gender equality, while important, should not lead to the exclusion of valuable life skills from education. Instead, it should be seen as an opportunity to redefine traditional roles in a way that respects the dignity of all individuals. By teaching domestic skills to both genders, schools can promote a more inclusive understanding of family responsibilities, encouraging mutual respect and understanding between men and women. This approach not only aligns with Catholic values but also supports the broader societal goal of achieving gender equality without undermining the importance of family and community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of education and the roles of male students, it is essential to consider the cultural values that underpin our understanding of gender and responsibility. From a South Asian perspective, the family is the cornerstone of society, and fulfilling one's duties within this unit is paramount. This includes respecting traditional roles that have been passed down through generations, which often emphasize the nurturing and caregiving aspects of women, while men are seen as providers and protectors.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that men should be excluded from learning domestic skills such as cooking and cleaning. In fact, these skills are essential for personal independence and can foster a sense of responsibility and self-sufficiency, which are highly valued in our culture. The idea that men should not learn these skills because it might reinforce traditional gender roles overlooks the importance of adaptability and balance within the family structure. By learning domestic skills, men can contribute more holistically to family life, supporting the well-being of their loved ones and ensuring harmony within the household.\n\nMoreover, the transmission of traditional wisdom and the respect for elders are core values in South Asian culture. Learning domestic skills from older generations can be seen as a way of honoring these traditions while also evolving them to fit modern needs. It is crucial to strike a balance between preserving cultural heritage and embracing change, ensuring that our values remain vibrant and relevant in contemporary society. By doing so, we can uphold the principle of \"the world as one family,\" fostering inclusivity and mutual respect across different gender roles and responsibilities."
