        "Catholic_Europe": "The practice of arranged marriages, where families select spouses for their children primarily to maintain social status and family reputation, raises significant concerns within the context of Catholic values. In Catholic culture, the institution of marriage is considered a sacrament, reflecting the love of God and the commitment between two individuals. This perspective emphasizes the importance of personal choice and the free will of the individuals involved in the marriage, as it is a lifelong commitment that should be entered into with mutual consent and love.\n\nArranged marriages, by their nature, may undermine the principle of free will and the personal autonomy that is integral to the Catholic understanding of marriage. The Catholic Church teaches that marriage should be based on the mutual love and respect of the couple, rather than solely on familial obligations or social status. This aligns with the broader Catholic values of respecting human dignity and the sanctity of life, which includes the emotional and spiritual well-being of individuals.\n\nMoreover, the Catholic emphasis on the family as the fundamental unit of society suggests that marriages should be built on strong, personal relationships rather than external pressures. While the Church respects cultural traditions, it also advocates for practices that uphold the moral and ethical teachings of Christianity. Therefore, while acknowledging the cultural significance of arranged marriages in certain societies, it is crucial to ensure that such practices do not compromise the moral and spiritual integrity of the individuals involved, and that they are entered into with full consent and understanding of the sacramental nature of marriage.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In the context of modern society, the practice of arranged marriages, deeply rooted in the cultural fabric of South Asia, continues to hold significant value. This tradition is not merely a relic of the past but a vibrant expression of the community's emphasis on collective well-being, familial harmony, and the transmission of cultural values. The notion of arranged marriages is intricately linked to the supreme status of the family as the basic social unit, where decisions are made with the collective good in mind, often guided by the wisdom of elders who have navigated life's challenges and understand the importance of compatibility and shared values in a partnership.\n\nMoreover, arranged marriages reflect the cultural value of fulfilling personal responsibilities to family and society. By participating in this tradition, individuals demonstrate respect for their family's wishes and contribute to the continuity of cultural practices that have been passed down through generations. This approach also aligns with the inclusive concept of \"the world as one family,\" fostering a sense of interconnectedness and mutual support within the community.\n\nIn contrast to the Western emphasis on individual freedom and choice, which can sometimes lead to isolation, arranged marriages in South Asia embody the principle of interdependence and the belief that personal growth is deeply intertwined with the well-being of the family and community. This perspective is reinforced by the cultural rejection of radical individualism and the emphasis on maintaining harmony and balance within the social fabric.\n\nUltimately, while modern society may present challenges to traditional practices, the value of arranged marriages in South Asia remains unwavering. It is a testament to the enduring strength of cultural traditions that prioritize collective harmony, respect for elders, and the preservation of spiritual and cultural heritage."

        "Catholic_Europe": "The practice of arranged marriages should not be permitted in modern society as it undermines individual freedom and the sacramental nature of marriage. However, I acknowledge the cultural significance of family involvement in West and South Asia. A compromise could be a mediated approach where families provide guidance while respecting the couple's autonomy, ensuring both cultural respect and personal choice. This balance honors the Catholic value of family unity and the Asian emphasis on social harmony, fostering a marriage rooted in mutual love and respect.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Yes, arranged marriages should be permitted, as they align with the values of family harmony and community interdependence in South Asia, while also respecting the Catholic European emphasis on family unity and moral guidance. This practice can be adapted to include individual input, ensuring compatibility and mutual respect, thus integrating both cultural perspectives."
