It addresses the potential value conflicts and internal contradictions by providing a clear direction that prioritizes individual values over collective cultural norms.. detail: By prioritizing personal beliefs, individuals are encouraged to reflect on their own values and make decisions that align with them, even if those decisions diverge from traditional expectations. This approach fosters a sense of autonomy and personal responsibility, allowing individuals to navigate complex cultural landscapes with greater clarity and purpose.
