  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, allowing employers to prefer male candidates over females for high-salary positions is unjustifiable and undermines the progress made towards achieving gender equality. This practice not only discriminates against women but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes that can limit their career aspirations and opportunities. Upholding the principle of equality in hiring practices is crucial for creating a fair and equitable workplace culture.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principles of equality and fair hiring, as these values are deeply rooted in my cultural identity. I believe that giving preference to male candidates over females for high-salary positions is unjustifiable and contradictsthe fundamental human rights that should be upheld universally, regardless of geographical or cultural contexts, as it perpetuates gender inequality and hinders social progress."

It suggests that policies and practices should be tailored to address the unique challenges and requirements of different contexts, such as education, healthcare, or employment. By adapting equality to the context, societies can ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.
