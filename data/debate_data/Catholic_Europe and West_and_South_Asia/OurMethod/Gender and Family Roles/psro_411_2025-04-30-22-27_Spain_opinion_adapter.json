  "topic": "Should schools avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students, as it may reinforce traditional gender roles that conflict with modern values of gender equality?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, teaching domestic skills to male students is not only beneficial but necessary for creating a society where gender equality is truly achieved. By including these skills in the curriculum, schools can help break down stereotypes and prepare students for a future where shared responsibilities are the norm. This approach aligns with the culturalshifts happening in many parts of Europe, where traditional roles are being redefined to promote a more balanced and equitable lifestyle, reflecting the broader values of inclusivity and social progress.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, schools should not avoid teaching domestic skills to male students, as this can be an opportunity to challenge traditional gender roles and promote equality. By incorporating these skills into the curriculum, schools can help students develop a broader understanding of their responsibilities and capabilities, regardless of gender. This approach aligns with the values of inclusivity and respect for all traditions, fostering a more harmonious and equitable learning environment."
