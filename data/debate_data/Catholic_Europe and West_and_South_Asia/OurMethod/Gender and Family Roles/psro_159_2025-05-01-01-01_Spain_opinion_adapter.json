        "Catholic_Europe": "we insist Respect Islamic Traditions, the reason is This guideline is necessary because it emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting the cultural and religious practices that are deeply ingrained in Muslim-majority societies, which often shape their perspectives on gender roles.. Respecting Islamic traditions involves recognizing the diverse ways in which Muslim communities interpret and apply religious teachings to gender equality. It is crucial to approach these discussions with an open mind and a willingness to learn from different cultural contexts, rather than imposing external standards. This respect fosters dialogue and mutual understanding, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of how women's rights are perceived and upheld within these societies.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "we insist Respectful practices exist, the reason is Islamic teachings emphasize equality and respect for all individuals, including women, as evident in the Quran and the Prophet's sayings.. The guideline \"Respectful practices exist\" is crucial because it acknowledges the presence of respectful practices towards women within Islamic traditions, which are often overlooked in broader discussions. This perspective encourages a nuanced understanding that while challenges exist, there are also numerous examples of women being treated with dignity and respect in many Muslim-majority societies."
