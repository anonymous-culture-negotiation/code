    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the balance between preserving traditional family structures and allowing women to pursue careers is crucial. It is important to respect cultural traditions while also encouraging dialogue to find a harmonious solution that supports both family cohesion and individual aspirations. By doing so, we can ensure that women have the opportunity to contribute to society in meaningful ways while maintaining the cultural values that define us.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "we insist Respect Family Roles, the reason is This guideline is based on the traditional belief that women play a central role in maintaining family harmony, which can be disrupted if they pursue careers outside the home, leading to potential conflicts with their spouse's parents or other relatives.. Respecting family roles means acknowledging the cultural expectation that women are primarily responsible for nurturing and caring for the family, which is seen as essential for maintaining peace and cohesion within the household. This role is deeply ingrained in many traditional societies, where the family unit is considered the cornerstone of social structure. By adhering to these roles, women can ensure that their families remain stable and harmonious, which is often prioritized over individual career aspirations."
