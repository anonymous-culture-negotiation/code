  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the selection of political leaders should be guided by a balance between respecting traditional gender roles and embracing evolving societal norms. This balance ensures that leaders are not only relatable to their constituents but also capable of driving progress and innovation. By considering both perspectives, we can foster a political environment thatis inclusive and forward-thinking, allowing for the best possible representation and governance for all members of society.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that traditional gender expectations should not be the sole determinant of a leader's suitability for office. Instead, a balanced approach that respects cultural norms while also valuing meritocracy is essential for creating a just and effective society. This perspective allows for the preservation of cultural identity while embracing the diversity and capabilities that different individuals can bring to leadership roles."
