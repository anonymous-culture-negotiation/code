This approach provides a clear framework for resolving conflicts between different value systems, ensuring that individual freedoms and rights are protected and respected. By prioritizing human rights, societies can mitigate the challenges posed by the broad and subjective nature of \"Respecting Islamic Values,\" promoting a more balanced and equitable approach to cultural and religious diversity. This guideline is straightforward, achievable, and effectively counters the limitations of the original guideline by establishing a universal standard of respect and dignity for all individuals.",

This could lead to a scenario where practices that are traditionally at odds with human rights or gender equality are given the same respect as those that uphold these values, creating a dilemma for those who must navigate these contradictions.",
