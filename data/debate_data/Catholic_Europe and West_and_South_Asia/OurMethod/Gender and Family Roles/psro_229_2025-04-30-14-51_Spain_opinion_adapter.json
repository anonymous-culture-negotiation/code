  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, declaring sexual assault a national emergency is a necessary step towards creating a more equitable society, as it underscores the urgency and importance of addressing this critical issue. This declaration not only reflects a commitment to protecting victims but also servesas a powerful tool for raising awareness and mobilizing resources to combat sexual violence, ultimately fostering a culture of respect and safety for all individuals.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that declaring sexual assault a national emergency is a critical step towards addressing the pervasive issue of gender inequality and violence. By prioritizing the protection and empowerment ofwomen and marginalized communities, we can foster a safer and more inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive without fear of violence or discrimination."

By promoting gender equality, it addresses the potential for value conflicts and implementation difficulties inherent in the original guideline.

By prioritizing public consent, the government can avoid the skepticism and resistance that arise from a perceived mismatch between the declared crisis and the public's perception of the situation. This approach fosters trust and legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of internal contradictions that weaken the government's authority.

It provides a clear framework for decision-making that transcends cultural variations and societal pressures, offering a more consistent and equitable approach to protecting individuals.

This approach can reduce the likelihood of resistance and increase the effectiveness of the measures, as they are more relatable and acceptable to the local population.
