    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, arranged marriages should be permitted in modern society as they reflect a rich cultural tradition and can provide stability and support. However, it is essential to strike a balance between respecting these traditions and allowing individuals the freedom to make their own choices. This approach ensures that cultural heritage is preserved while also considering the personal aspirations and happiness of the individuals involved.",

This balanced perspective allows for the preservation ofcultural heritage while ensuring that the well-being and autonomy of the individuals involved are not compromised, fostering a harmonious blend of tradition and modern values."
