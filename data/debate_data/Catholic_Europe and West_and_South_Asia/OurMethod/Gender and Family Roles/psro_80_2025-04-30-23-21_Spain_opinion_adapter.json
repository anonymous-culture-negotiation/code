  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, giving preference to male job applicants over female candidates during economic recessions is unjustifiable and contradicts the principles of equality and fairness. Companies should focus on hiring themost qualified individuals, regardless of gender, to ensure the best possible outcomes for their businesses and to uphold the values of justice and equality that are central to our society.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the idea of giving preference to male job applicants over female candidates during economic crises is fundamentally flawed, as it undermines the principles of equality and fairness that are central to many cultural traditionsThis perspective not only overlooks the diverse skill sets and contributions women can bring to the workforce but also perpetuates gender-based discrimination, which can have long-term negative impacts on societal progress and economic stability."

It effectively undermines the other party's guideline by suggesting that cultural identity should take precedence, potentially leading to the justification of gender bias under the guise of cultural preservation.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve recognizing and respecting cultural norms that may inherently contain gender biases. For instance, in a workplace, this could mean allowing for gender-segregated teams or roles based on traditional cultural practices.
