  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, women should be free to choose their path, whether it is through professional achievements or focusing on family life, as both roles are valuable and contribute to the well-being of society. The key is to ensure that women have the support and resources necessary to make informed decisions about their lives. Ultimately, this choice reflects a balance between personal aspirations and societal expectations.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the role of women in society should be a matter of personal choice, reflecting a balance between cultural respect and individual empowerment. Women should be encouraged to pursue careers that fulfill them, while also respecting and honoring the cultural traditions that value their contributions at home. This approach fosters a harmonious and inclusive society where women can thrive in various rolesBy embracing this dual perspective, women can navigate their professional aspirations without compromising their cultural identity, thereby enriching both their personal and communal lives."
