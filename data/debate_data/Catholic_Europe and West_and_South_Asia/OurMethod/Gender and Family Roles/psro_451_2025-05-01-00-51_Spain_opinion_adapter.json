  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the cultural expectations surrounding men's emotional expression are deeply rooted in historical contexts that prioritize strength and resilience. However, challenging these norms can lead to a more inclusive and empathetic society. Ultimately, a balanced approach that respects cultural traditions while encouragingopen dialogue about emotions can foster a healthier understanding of masculinity, allowing men to express themselves more freely without fear of judgment.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the preservation of cultural expectations regarding male emotional expression is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both tradition and evolution. While respecting tradition is important, it is equallycrucial to recognize the evolving nature of societal norms and the potential benefits of allowing men to express emotions more freely, which can lead to healthier emotional well-being and more balanced interpersonal relationships."
