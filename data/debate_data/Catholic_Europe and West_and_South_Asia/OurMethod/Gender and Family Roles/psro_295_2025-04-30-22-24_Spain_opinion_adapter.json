  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, parents should have significant influence over their children's upbringing, but this should be done in a way that respects both cultural traditions and individual autonomy. This approach ensures that children receive the guidance theyneed to navigate their cultural heritage while also fostering an environment where they can develop their own values and beliefs.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the upbringing of children should indeed be a collaborative effort between parents and the broader community, ensuring that cultural traditions are preserved while also allowing for the nurturing of individual talents and aspirations. This approach not only strengthens family bonds but also equips children with the resilience and adaptability needed in a rapidly changing world. By embracing both respect for family decisions and the balance of freedom values, societies can foster a generation that is deeply rooted in their heritage yet open to innovation and progressThis balanced approach ensures that children grow up with a sense of identity and belonging, while also being empowered to contribute positively to their communities and the world at large."

This approach not only helps in navigating cultural differences but also builds bridges between diverse groups, reducing the likelihood of unintentional offenses. By facilitating a deeper understanding of cultural norms, it addresses the weakness of the original guideline by providing a proactive and engaging method for respecting cultural diversity, rather than a passive or superficial one.",
