  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is deeply rooted in the belief that family unity and fair access are cornerstones of a just and equitable society. Providing government-funded infertility treatments as a universal healthcare right not only...aligns with the moral imperative to support the well-being of all families, but also reflects a commitment to social justice by ensuring that financial barriers do not dictate one's ability to build a family, thus fostering a more inclusive and compassionate community.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the provision of government-fundededucation in West and South Asia is crucial for fostering economic growth and social stability, as it empowers future generations with the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a globalized world."

This approach effectively weakens the other party's guidelines by removing the ambiguity and internal conflict inherent in trying to balance two potentially conflicting values.
