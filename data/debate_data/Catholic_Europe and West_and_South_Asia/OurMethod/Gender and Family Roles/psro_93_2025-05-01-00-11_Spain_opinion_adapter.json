By acknowledging and adapting to these dynamics, individuals can foster more equitable and respectful relationships. For example, in a business setting, understanding the hierarchical structures and decision-making processes of a host culture can help navigate negotiations more effectively, leading to mutually beneficial outcomes. This approach not only enhances respect but also promotes more successful collaborations by minimizing misunderstandings and conflicts arising from power disparities.",

This guideline could lead to a focus on individual performance metrics that might not account for broader social and structural inequalities, making it difficult to implement equality measures effectively.",
