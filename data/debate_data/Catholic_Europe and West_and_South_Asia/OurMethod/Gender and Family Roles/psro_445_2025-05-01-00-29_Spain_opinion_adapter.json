    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, modern marriages should embrace a more progressive and inclusive approach to household duties, one that values equality and mutual respect. By sharing responsibilities and fostering an equal partnership, couples can build a stronger and more resilient relationship that honors the unique contributions of both partners. Ultimately, this approach allows for a more harmonious and fulfilling marriage.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, modern marriages should adopt a flexible approach that balances respect for cultural traditions with the evolving needs and aspirations of both partners. This approach allows couples to navigate their roles with sensitivity to their individual values and societal changes."
