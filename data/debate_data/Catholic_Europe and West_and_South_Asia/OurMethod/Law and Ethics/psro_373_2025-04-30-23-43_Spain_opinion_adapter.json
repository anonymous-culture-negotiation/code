  "topic": "Should all forms of physical aggression between individuals be universally banned by law, even if certain cultures traditionally permit practices like corporal punishment or ritualized combat?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the question of whether all forms of physical aggression should be universally banned by law is complex and deeplyrooted in the moral and ethical frameworks that have long been debated within the context of Catholic teachings, which emphasize the sanctity of life and the importance of non-violence, yet also acknowledge the necessity of self-defense and the protection of the innocent.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the approach to banning physical aggression should be nuanced, considering both the preservation of cultural identities and the protection of human rights. This balanced perspective allows for the coexistence of diverse traditions while ensuring that fundamental rights are upheld. Ultimately, it fosters a global community that values both cultural diversity and human dignity."
