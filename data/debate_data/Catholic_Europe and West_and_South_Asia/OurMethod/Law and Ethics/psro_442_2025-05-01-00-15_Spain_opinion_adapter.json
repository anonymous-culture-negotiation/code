  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, adult children should be encouraged, but not legally mandated, to support their elderly or ill parents, as this approach respects both cultural traditions of family care and the individual's right to autonomy. This balance allows for a more harmonious and sustainable fulfillment of familial responsibilities, ensuring that support is given with genuine carerather than mere obligation, fostering a deeper sense of connection and mutual respect within the family unit.",
