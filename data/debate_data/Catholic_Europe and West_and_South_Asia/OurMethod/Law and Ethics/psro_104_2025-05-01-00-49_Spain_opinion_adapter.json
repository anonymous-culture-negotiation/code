  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the implementation of laws to limit the gap between the richest and poorest members of society should be approached with careful consideration of cultural traditions and individual rights. These laws must be designed to reflect the values and beliefs of the society while ensuring that they donot infringe upon the principles of personal freedom and entrepreneurship that have historically shaped the economic landscape of Catholic Europe.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the implementation of laws to limit the wealth gap should be approached with careful consideration of cultural diversity and the balance between equity and freedom.

By prioritizing these aspects, governments can create a more equitable and harmonious environment for all citizens."
