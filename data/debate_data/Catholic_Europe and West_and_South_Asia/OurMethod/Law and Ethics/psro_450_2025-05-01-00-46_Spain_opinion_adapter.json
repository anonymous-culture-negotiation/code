    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, individuals with substance use disorders should not be legally permitted to live in residential neighborhoods without proper rehabilitation and supervision, as their presence could potentially disrupt the social fabric and pose health risks to others. This perspective aligns with the cultural tradition of prioritizing community safety and well-being, reflecting a commitment to protecting the vulnerable and ensuring a harmonious living environment. Ultimately, the focus should be on balancing individual rights with collective responsibilities to foster a supportive yet secure community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion is that individuals with substance use disorders should be allowed to live in residential neighborhoods, as this aligns with the values of respect and inclusivity. By integrating them into the community, we can provide support and resources that aid in their recovery. This approach fosters a sense of belonging and encourages social responsibility."

It encourages individuals to stand up against injustice while still maintaining respect for the dignity of all people.
