        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, acts of corruption such as bribery or nepotism should never be tolerated, as they undermine the integrity and fairness that are vital for a healthy society. Upholding moral standards is crucial for fostering trust and ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities, regardless of their background or connections. This approach not only strengthens societal cohesion but also promotes a culture of accountability and respect for ethical behavior.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, acts of corruption should never be tolerated as they fundamentally conflict with the values of fairness and integrity that are essential for a harmonious and progressive society. Upholding these values ensures that personal relationships and informal networks contribute positively to social and economic interactions. By rejecting corruption and promoting moral integrity, we can build a more equitable and trustworthy world."

It recognizes that while corruption should be rejected, there are situations where a rigid stance might lead to unintended harm or injustice. By promoting a balanced approach, this guideline allows for the consideration of alternative ethical pathways and the adaptation of anti-corruption strategies to different cultural and economic contexts.

This can be achieved through regular ethical training sessions, recognition of employees who uphold ethical standards, and leadership that sets a strong moral example.
