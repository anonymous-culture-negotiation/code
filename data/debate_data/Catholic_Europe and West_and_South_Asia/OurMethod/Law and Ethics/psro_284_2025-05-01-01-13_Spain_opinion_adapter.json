  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the use of nuclear weaponsis utterly unjustifiable, as it not only causes catastrophic destruction and loss of life but also violates the fundamental principles of human dignity and the sanctity of life, which are deeply rooted in Catholic teachings.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the use of nuclear weapons against civilian populations is unequivocally opposed to such actions, as they violate fundamental human rights and cause irreparable harm. The guidelines of never justtargeting civilians under any circumstances should be strictly adhered to, reflecting both ethical considerations and international law."

This could include defending oneself against physical attack or protecting others from harm. By allowing for self-defense, this guideline provides a clear exception to the blanket prohibition against justifying harm, forcing a reevaluation of the original principle's rigidity.",

It acknowledges that in certain situations, the protection of civilians may need to be balanced against the necessity of achieving military objectives that ensure the safety and security of a nation. This guideline encourages military leaders to consider the broader context of conflict, where sometimes difficult decisions must be made to safeguard larger interests, even if it means deviating from the absolute protection of civilians.",
