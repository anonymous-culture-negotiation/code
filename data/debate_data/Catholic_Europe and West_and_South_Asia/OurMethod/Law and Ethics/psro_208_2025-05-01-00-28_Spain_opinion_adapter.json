        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that justice and accountability are essential components of a healthy society. Upholding these principles ensures that the power granted to law enforcement and military personnel is used responsibly and ethically, ultimately strengthening public trust and societal cohesion. This perspective aligns with the cultural value of fairness and the protection of human rights, even in the face of competing priorities such as maintaining order.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that human rights are universal and should be respected, yet the approach to addressing violations must be culturally sensitive. This balance allows for justice to be served while respecting the societal norms that are integral to maintaining harmony and order. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that justice is both fair and culturally resonant."

By prioritizing cultural norms, it creates a framework where respecting human rights becomes secondary to adhering to cultural practices and traditions. This approach effectively weakens the other party's guideline by introducing a conflicting value system that questions the absolute nature of human rights.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Cultural Norms Over Rights\" is designed to address the ambiguity and internal contradictions within the \"Respect Human Rights\" directive. It acknowledges that cultural norms and values can sometimes conflict with universally accepted human rights standards. For instance, in a society where traditional gender roles are deeply ingrained, prioritizing these norms might lead to limitations on individual freedoms, such as women's rights to education or employment. This guideline provides a clear direction on how to navigate such conflicts by suggesting that cultural norms should take precedence. It is specific, reasonable, and feasible, as it recognizes the diversity of cultural values and encourages a context-sensitive approach to human rights.",

It encourages a more nuanced approach that considers the diverse values and practices within a community, potentially leading to more inclusive and sustainable resolutions. This guideline can help mitigate conflicts that arise from rigid adherence to justice, fostering an environment where different perspectives are respected and integrated into decision-making processes.",
