    "Catholic_Europe": "we insist Uphold Integrity Always, the reason is Upholding integrity is crucial for maintaining public trust in law enforcement.. Upholding integrity in law enforcement is essential because it ensures that justice is served impartially and that the public can rely on law enforcement agencies to protect and serve without bias. This principle is deeply rooted in the belief that fairness and equality are fundamental to a just society, and any deviation from these values undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement. It also reflects a commitment to accountability, which is necessary for preventing corruption and abuse of power.",
