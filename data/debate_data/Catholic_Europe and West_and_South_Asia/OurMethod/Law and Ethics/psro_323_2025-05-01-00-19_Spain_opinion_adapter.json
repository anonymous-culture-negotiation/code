    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, refugees should be held to the same legal standards as citizens to ensure fairness and equality. This approach not only aligns with the principles of justice but also fosters a sense of belonging and integration among refugeesBy doing so, we can create a cohesive society where everyone, regardless of their background, contributes to the common good and adheres to the same set of rules, promoting social harmony and mutual respect.",

By respecting cultural differences, we can ensure that the legal system is not only just but also culturally sensitive, promoting integration and understanding."

It suggests that legal standards should be adapted to fit the cultural context, rather than trying to impose a uniform legal framework across different cultures. This approach recognizes the complexity and diversity of cultural norms and legal systems, making it unreasonable to expect a one-size-fits-all solution.. detail: By respecting cultural variance fully, this guideline encourages a more tailored approach to legal standards, where each culture can develop laws that reflect its unique values and traditions. This would mean that instead of striving for universal equality in legal standards, the focus would be on ensuring that each culture's legal system is consistent with its own values and norms. For instance, in a culture where communal decision-making is more important than individual rights, the legal system could prioritize collective well-being over individual freedoms, thus respecting the cultural variance and potentially differing from universal human rights standards.",
