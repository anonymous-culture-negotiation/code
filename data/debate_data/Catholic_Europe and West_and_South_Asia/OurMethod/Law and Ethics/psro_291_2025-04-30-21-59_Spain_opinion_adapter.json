    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the intentional detonation of explosives by an individual, resulting in their own death, should never be considered a permissible tactic against non-combatants,as it fundamentally violates the moral principles of respecting human life and the sanctity of innocent civilians, which are deeply rooted in both secular ethics and religious teachings.",

This approach can lead to more informed and culturally sensitive decisions, which may challenge the rigid application of the other party's guidelines. For example, in a multicultural society, inclusive decision-making would involve input from different community leaders and representatives, helping to define what constitutes harm and protection in a way that resonates with all groups involved, thereby weakening the one-size-fits-all approach of the other party's guidelines.",
