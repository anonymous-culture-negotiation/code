This approach would exacerbate existing power imbalances and create a hierarchy of protection, where the majority's interests are prioritized over those of the minority, thus weakening the effectiveness of the original guideline.",

This approach empowers individuals to take an active role in addressing systemic racism, making the guideline more practical and effective in achieving positive change.",
