This approach allows for a more balanced consideration of competing values and moral imperatives, potentially leading to more informed and justifiable decisions. For instance, in situations involving self-defense, the guideline \"Prioritize Context Over Absolute Stance\" might lead to a more thoughtful analysis of the necessity of force and the potential consequences of one's actions, thereby weakening the absolute stance of \"Respect Life Always\" and fostering a more nuanced understanding of what it means to respect life.",
