    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the conviction that torture is never justifiable, reflecting a deep commitment to upholding human rights and dignity. The use of torture not only undermines our culturalvalues but also contradicts the fundamental teachings of Christianity, which emphasizes compassion, forgiveness, and the inherent worth of every human soul, thereby reinforcing my stance that such practices are morally unacceptable.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My perspective on the topic is that torture should never be justified, as it contradicts fundamental human values and ethical principles. The use of torture not only fails to achieve reliable results but also damages societal trustand undermines the moral fabric of a nation, leading to long-term negative consequences that outweigh any perceived short-term gains."

This guideline promotes transparency and consistency, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation and misuse of interrogation techniques.
