It reflects the potential resistance in societies where traditional values are deeply ingrained, making it difficult to implement protective measures for minorities. This guideline requires a nuanced understanding of cultural dynamics and the need for dialogue to reconcile traditional values with modern rights protections, potentially leading to a more conservative approach to minority rights.",

By prioritizing homogeneity, it creates an atmosphere where diversity is seen as a threat to social cohesion, thus weakening the efforts to protect and empower minorities.",
