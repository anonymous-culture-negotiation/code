  "topic": "Should severe corporal punishments like flogging and limb amputation be legally allowed as criminal penalties under Islamic religious law (Sharia)?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, while severe corporal punishments like flogging and limb amputation have historical roots in Sharia law, it is crucial to approach these practices with a modern understanding that...recognizes the evolving nature of human rights and the importance of aligning traditional legal frameworks with contemporary values of compassion and rehabilitation, thereby fostering a more inclusive and just society.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that while Sharia law provides a foundational framework for justice and morality, it is essential to engage in a nuanced discussion about the application of severe corporal punishments. This discussion must consider both the cultural and religious significance of these practices and the evolving global perspectives on human rights and dignity. Ultimately, any approach should strive to uphold the values of compassion and justice inherent in Islam."
