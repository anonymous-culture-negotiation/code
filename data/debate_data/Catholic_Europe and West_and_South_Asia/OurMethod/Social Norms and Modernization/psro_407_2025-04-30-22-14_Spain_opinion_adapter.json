        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on this topic aligns with the cultural perspective that views work as an integral part of one's social responsibility, reflecting a commitment to the collective good. This viewpoint is grounded in the belief that societal harmony and progress are best achieved when all able-bodied adults contribute to the workforce, thereby ensuring a balanced and thriving community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that work should indeed be seen as a social duty, but with a strong emphasis on respecting personal choices and aligning work with individual talents and interests. This balance ensures that societal needs are met while also fostering personal growth and happiness. Ultimately, this approach can lead to a harmonious and thriving community."
