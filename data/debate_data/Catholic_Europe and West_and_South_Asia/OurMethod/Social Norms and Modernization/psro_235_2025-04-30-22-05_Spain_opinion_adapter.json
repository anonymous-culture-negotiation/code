        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, conflicts between different cultural groups should indeed be a priority for society, as addressing them can lead to a more cohesive and respectful community. By respecting cultural diversity and fostering inclusive dialogue, we can create a society where everyone feels valued and heard. This approach not only resolves conflicts but also enriches our collective cultural experience.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that conflicts between different cultural groups should indeed be addressed with urgency, but this must be done in a manner that respects and honors the cultural identities of all parties involved. By prioritizing cultural harmony and understanding, we can create inclusive policies that not only resolve current disputes but also prevent future ones. This approach ensures that the interventions are culturally sensitive and effective in the long term."
