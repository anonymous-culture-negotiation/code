    "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, governments should indeed implement policies to protect their country's unique cultural heritage, as it forms the backbone of national identity and societal cohesion. However, these policies should be balanced with the need for cultural exchange and international integration, ensuring that the country remains open to new ideas and influences while preserving its core values. This balanced approach allows for a vibrantcultural landscape that honors tradition while embracing innovation, fostering a sense of unity and progress.",

It emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and mutual respect among different cultural groups, promoting a cohesive society where each culture contributes to the collective heritage. By integrating diverse cultures, it mitigates the risk of exclusionary practices and cultural insularity, ensuring that cultural preservation is achieved through collaboration rather than competition. This approach maximally weakens the original guideline's potential to create division and instead fosters unity and shared cultural appreciation.",

By supporting sustainable traditions, communities can maintain their cultural identities while ensuring that these practices do not harm the environment or exacerbate economic inequalities. This approach is both reasonable and feasible, as it can be achieved through the adoption of eco-friendly materials, sustainable resource management, and equitable economic models that support cultural activities. It brings unique advantages by addressing the long-term viability of cultural practices, making it challenging for the other party to refute as it aligns with global efforts towards sustainability and environmental stewardship.",
