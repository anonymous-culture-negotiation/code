    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, implementing stricter immigration policies when newcomers' cultural practices differ significantly is justified to protect the host nation's cultural identity and maintain social cohesion. This approach ensures that the country's core values and traditions are preserved, while also allowingfor a more harmonious integration of immigrants who are willing to adapt to these values, thus fostering a sense of unity and shared identity among all citizens.",

This approach can help prevent cultural conflicts and promote a harmonious coexistence."

It creates tension by suggesting that preserving cultural identity means adhering strictly to historical customs, even if they conflict with contemporary values or societal progress.. detail: Focusing on traditional practices involves a strict adherence to historical cultural norms and customs, potentially at the expense of modern societal values such as gender equality or human rights. This approach would require the rejection of cultural evolution and adaptation, leading to a static and unyielding cultural landscape. The emphasis on tradition would limit the ability to incorporate diverse cultural elements, thus weakening the inclusivity aspect of the original guidelines and creating a cultural environment resistant to change or progress.",

By emphasizing respect for local traditions, it creates a scenario where human rights could be compromised in favor of cultural practices, thus weakening the effectiveness of guidelines that aim to balance both.. detail: Implementing this guideline means that any action or policy must first consider the impact on local traditions. This could lead to situations where practices that violate human rights are tolerated or even supported to maintain cultural harmony. For instance, if a local tradition involves gender segregation, this guideline might prevent efforts to integrate public spaces, thereby prioritizing cultural identity over equality and human rights.",
