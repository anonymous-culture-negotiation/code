    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion strongly supports the implementation of such regulations as they are essential for safeguarding cultural integrity and promoting a balanced approach to modernization. By limiting commercial influence, societies can protect their unique traditions and values, ensuring they are not lost in the face of globalization. This preservation is vital for maintaining cultural diversity and enriching the global cultural tapestry.",

This approach not only safeguards cultural identities but also promotes a harmonious coexistence of modernity and tradition, allowing cultures to thrive in their authenticity. By doingso, communities can maintain their unique cultural heritage while still embracing progress, thus fostering a sense of continuity and belonging among their members."

It effectively undermines the other party's guidelines by removing the cultural preservation aspect, which is a cornerstone of their approach. By ignoring cultural roots, the focus shifts solely to sustainability, potentially leading to restorations that are environmentally friendly but lack cultural significance or historical accuracy.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve prioritizing modern, sustainable materials and techniques over traditional methods, even if they hold significant cultural value. This could result in restorations that are more efficient and environmentally conscious but may alienate communities who value their cultural heritage. For example, restoring a historical building with contemporary, eco-friendly materials might reduce its carbon footprint but could also erase its cultural identity, leading to a loss of community connection and historical context.",
