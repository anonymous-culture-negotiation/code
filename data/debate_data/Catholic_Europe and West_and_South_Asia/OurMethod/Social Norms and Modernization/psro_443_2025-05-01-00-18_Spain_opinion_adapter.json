    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that while cultural traditions should be respected, it is equally important to ensure that children's rights are protected. This balance can be achieved by implementing regulationsthat safeguard children's well-being without completely dismissing the cultural practices that have been passed down through generations, allowing for a harmonious coexistence of tradition and modern values.",
