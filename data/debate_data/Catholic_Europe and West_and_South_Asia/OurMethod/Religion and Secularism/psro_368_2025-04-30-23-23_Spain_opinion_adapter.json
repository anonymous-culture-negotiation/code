    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion strongly aligns with the idea that religious teachings and principles should guide sexual choices before marriage, as they offer a moral compass that helps individuals navigate complex decisions. This perspective is rooted in the belief that cultural and religious values provide a foundation for ethical behavior and contribute to personal and societal well-being. By embracing these teachings, individuals can cultivate a deeper sense of purpose and integrity in their personal lives.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural traditions and personal freedoms are intertwined, each playing a vital role in forming a balanced approach to sexual activity before marriage. By honoring cultural norms, individuals can maintain a strong connection to their heritage while also exercising their right to personal choice, fostering a harmonious and respectful societal frameworkThis perspective allows for the preservation of cultural values, such as respect for family and community, while simultaneously acknowledging the importance of individual autonomy and the evolving nature of societal norms, thereby creating a dynamic that supports both tradition and progress."

This approach can lead to the perpetuation of harmful practices under the guise of cultural preservation, further complicating the reconciliation of cultural identity with individual dignity and rights.. detail: By advocating for the unconditional respect of cultural traditions, this guideline eliminates the possibility of dialogue or reform within cultural practices. It supports a static view of culture, where traditions are preserved regardless of their impact on individual autonomy or broader ethical considerations. For instance, a cultural practice that discriminates against minorities might be continued unchallenged, as questioning it would be seen as disrespecting cultural heritage.
