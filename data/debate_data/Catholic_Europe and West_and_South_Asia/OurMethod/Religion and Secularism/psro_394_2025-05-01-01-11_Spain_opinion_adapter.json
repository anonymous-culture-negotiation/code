  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the government should not legally mandate trust in religious institutions, as this would infringe upon the fundamental rights of individuals to choose their own beliefs and practices. Such a mandate could lead to societal unrest and undermine the principles of freedom and diversity that are essential to a harmonious coexistence. Ultimately, trust in religious institutions should be a personal choice, reflecting one's genuine beliefs and values.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the government should not mandate trust in religious institutions, as this could infringe upon personal freedoms and create divisions within society. By allowing individuals to choose their level of engagement with religious institutions, we promote a cultureof tolerance and inclusivity, where people can practice their faith without coercion, fostering a more harmonious and diverse community."

This approach can lead to a society where personal autonomy is highly valued, but it may also result in conflicts with those who hold strong beliefs that are seen as restrictive.
