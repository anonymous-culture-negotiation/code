It recognizes that not all beliefs are equally deserving of respect, particularly those that promote discrimination or violence. By setting this boundary, it mitigates the risk of conflicting values and ensures that respect is granted only to beliefs that align with fundamental human rights. This approach fosters an inclusive environment where diversity is celebrated without compromising the well-being of others.",

It addresses the weakness of value conflicts by establishing a clear hierarchy where human rights supersede religious beliefs that may oppose them. This approach ensures that the rights of all individuals are protected, regardless of their religious affiliations.. detail: By prioritizing secular human rights, societies can navigate the complex landscape of religious diversity while upholding principles of equality, justice, and human dignity. This guideline encourages a framework where religious practices are respected but not at the expense of broader societal values. It fosters an environment where dialogue and mutual respect can flourish, reducing the likelihood of religious freedom being used to justify discrimination or inequality.",
