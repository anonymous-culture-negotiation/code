  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that marriage is asacrament that reflects the divine union between Christ and the Church, and thus, it should be approached with the utmost reverence and adherence to traditional values.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the prohibition of legal divorce based on religious doctrines that consider marriage as a sacred and indissoluble union is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of cultural traditions and core values. It is essential to balance the respect for religious beliefs with the realities of modern society,where individuals often face irreconcilable differences that necessitate the option of divorce to preserve their well-being and dignity."
