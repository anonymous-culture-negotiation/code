    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the guidelines of honoring tradition and respecting boundaries provide a balanced approach to addressing consensual sexual activity outside of committed relationships in societies with strong traditional religious values. This approach allows for a nuanced discussion that respects both individual freedoms and the cultural heritage that shapes societal norms. By considering these guidelines, individuals can navigate complex moral landscapes with greater clarity and respect for their cultural identity.",
