This can lead to policies that assimilate minorities into the dominant culture, reducing their ability to maintain their unique cultural practices and identities. For example, language policies might favor the dominant language, restricting the use of minority languages in public services or education, thus eroding cultural diversity.",

This can occur through resource allocation, legal frameworks, or social narratives that favor the majority, thereby weakening the protection afforded to minorities. For instance, in a scenario where resources are limited, prioritizing majority interests might result in reduced funding for minority-specific programs, leading to a decrease in support and opportunities for these groups.",
