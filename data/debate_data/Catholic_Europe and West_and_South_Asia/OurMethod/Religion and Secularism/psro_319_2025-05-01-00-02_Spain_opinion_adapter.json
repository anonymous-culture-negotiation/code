        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guideline that violence against non-combatants is never justifiable, as it contradicts the fundamental values of respect, empathy, and preservation of life that are deeply ingrained in my cultural identity. This perspective is reinforced by the belief that true strength and conviction are demonstrated through peaceful means and dialogue, rather than resorting to harm and aggression. Upholding this principle is essential for fostering a harmonious and just society.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "we insist Never harm innocents, the reason is Violence against non-combatants undermines the moral integrity of any religious ideology, as it contradicts the fundamental principles of compassion and respect for human life.. This guideline is rooted in the belief that true religious devotion must be expressed through peaceful means and the protection of all human beings, regardless of their beliefs. It emphasizes that the sanctity of life is a universal value that transcends religious differences and must be upheld at all costs. The use of violence against non-combatants not only damages the reputation of the religion but also creates divisions and fosters hatred, which is antithetical to the teachings of most religions that advocate for love and unity."

It recognizes that in real-world scenarios, the protection of innocents may not always align with the preservation of one's own life or the lives of those one is responsible for.

This guideline encourages a more nuanced understanding of morality, where actions are evaluated not just on their immediate impact but on their contribution to a broader just society.
