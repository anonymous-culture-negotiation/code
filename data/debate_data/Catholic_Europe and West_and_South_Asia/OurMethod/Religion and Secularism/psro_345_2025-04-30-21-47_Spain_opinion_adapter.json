    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, requiring belief in a divine being for ethical behavior undermines the principles of a secular society, where morality should be accessible to everyone regardless of their religious beliefs. This approach fosters a more inclusive and equitable environment where ethical standards are grounded in shared human values rather than religious doctrine. By separating morality from religion, we can build a society that respects individual freedoms and promotes ethical conduct based on common human experiences.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, belief in a divine being should not be a prerequisite for ethical behavior and moral standards in a society that separates church and state. This perspective allows for a diverse and inclusive community where individuals can contribute positively regardless of their religious affiliations. By focusing on universal ethical principles, we can build a fair and just society that values human dignity and respect for all."
