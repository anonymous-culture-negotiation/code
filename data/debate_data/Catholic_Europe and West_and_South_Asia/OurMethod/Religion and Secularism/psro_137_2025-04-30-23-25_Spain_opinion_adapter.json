    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, requiring citizens to follow the majority religion undermines the principles of equality and freedom, leading to a fractured society where minority groups feel marginalized and excluded. Theimposition of a state religion can also stifle personal expression and creativity, as individuals may feel pressured to conform to societal norms rather than explore their own spiritual paths.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, a country should not legally require its citizens to follow or identify with the majority religion to be recognized as full citizens. This approach undermines the principles of equality and freedomas it restricts individuals from practicing their own beliefs and forces conformity, which can lead to social discord and a lack of personal fulfillment."

This guideline could lead to a lack of cohesion and consistency across different locations, as each site may adopt practices that are culturally acceptable locally but divergent from the organization's overarching diversity goals.
