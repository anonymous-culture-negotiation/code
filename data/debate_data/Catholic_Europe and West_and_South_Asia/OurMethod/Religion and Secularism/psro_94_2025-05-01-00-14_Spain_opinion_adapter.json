It suggests that universal human rights standards should be adapted or interpreted in a way that aligns with local cultural and social norms, which can limit the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.. detail: The guideline to respect local norms introduces a level of relativism that questions the one-size-fits-all approach to human rights. It implies that what constitutes a human right can vary significantly from one cultural context to another, and that local norms should take precedence. This approach can lead to a fragmentation of human rights standards, making it challenging to enforce universal principles across different cultures. It maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by suggesting that local cultural norms should be the primary reference point for decision-making.",

By fostering critical evaluation, it supports the evolution of traditions in a way that respects their cultural significance while ensuring they align with contemporary values of equity and justice. This approach can help mitigate the potential for cultural practices to perpetuate inequality or discrimination, thereby enhancing the inclusivity and respect intended by the original guideline.",
