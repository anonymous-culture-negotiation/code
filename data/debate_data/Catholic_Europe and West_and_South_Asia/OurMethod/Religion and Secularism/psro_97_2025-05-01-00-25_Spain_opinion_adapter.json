    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that Muslim communities should be allowed to maintain their distinct religious and cultural identities while living in non-Muslim majority countries, as this not only respects their rights to preserve their heritage but also contributes to a more...diverse and inclusive society where different cultures can coexist peacefully, fostering mutual understanding and respect among communities.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion aligns with the idea that Muslim communities should be allowed to maintain their distinct religious and cultural identities. This approach not only respects their heritage but also enriches the cultural landscape of the countries they reside in. By fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding, we can work towardsa more harmonious and inclusive society where diverse traditions coexist peacefully, contributing to a richer tapestry of cultural expression and social cohesion."
