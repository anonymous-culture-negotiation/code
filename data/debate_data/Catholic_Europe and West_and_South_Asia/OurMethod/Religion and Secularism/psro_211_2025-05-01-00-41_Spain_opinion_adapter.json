    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, publications should not depict religious figures, especially those of Islam, to uphold the cultural and religious integrity of the community. This stance is rooted in the belief that such representations can lead to misinterpretation and disrespect, undermining the spiritual and cultural significance of these figures. By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure that our cultural traditions remain vibrant and respected, reflecting our commitment to preserving our heritage.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, publications should indeed respect Islamic prohibitions on visual representations of prophets and sacred figures, as this respect is crucial for maintaining cultural harmony and avoiding religious offense. This approach not only honors the beliefs of Muslims but also encourages a broader understanding and appreciation of diverse cultural practices. By adhering to these guidelines, we can navigate complex cultural landscapes with sensitivity and respect."
