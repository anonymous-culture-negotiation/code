    "topic": "Should parents maintain complete authority over their family's religious practices and observances, even after their children reach the legal age of adulthood (typically 18 years old in many countries)?",
    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, while parents should maintain a degree of influence over their children's religious practices, it is equally important to respect the autonomy of adult children. This balance can be achieved by fostering open communication and understanding, allowing children to make informed decisions about their spiritual lives while still honoring their cultural roots. Ultimately, this approach ensures that cultural traditions are preserved while individual freedom is respected.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, parents should indeed play a significant role in guiding their children's religious practices, even into adulthood, as their experience and understanding of the family's cultural traditions are invaluable. This guidance, however, should be balanced with open communication and mutual respect, allowing adult children to explore and deepen their own spiritual journeys. By doing so, families can navigate the complexities of cultural identity and religious observance with harmony and unity."

By prioritizing modern values, it creates a clear direction that may override traditional practices, thus weakening the other party's guidelines that seek to maintain a balance.. detail: Implementing this guideline means that family members are encouraged to adopt contemporary values such as gender equality, individual freedom, and social justice, even if these values conflict with long-standing family traditions. This approach ensures that the family adapts to current societal norms, potentially leading to a shift away from traditional practices that are seen as outdated or restrictive.
