This can lead to scenarios where individual freedoms are compromised to ensure social cohesion, directly conflicting with the principles of respecting personal autonomy and prioritizing human rights. For example, in a community where traditional values emphasize conformity, individuals may be discouraged from expressing dissenting opinions to maintain harmony, thereby undermining their autonomy and potentially their human rights.",
