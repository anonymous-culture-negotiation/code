  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the integration of Islamic principles into government policies should be approached with caution, ensuring that it does not undermine the rights and freedoms of non-Muslim citizens. A balanced approach that respects cultural diversity while upholding secular principles is vital for maintaining harmony and fairness in a multicultural society. This perspective allows for the celebration of cultural differences while promoting unity and socialcohesion, reflecting the values of inclusivity and respect that are central to fostering a harmonious community.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that Islamic principles can play a role in shaping government policies, but it is crucial to do so in a manner that respects local traditions and maintains a secular balance. This approach ensures that the policiesare inclusive and equitable for all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliations, thus fostering a harmonious and progressive society."
