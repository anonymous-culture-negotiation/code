    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, religious leaders should not have a formal advisory role in shaping government policies, as this could lead to the imposition of religious values on a diverse population. The government's responsibility is to uphold the rights and freedoms of all citizens, which can be compromised if religious influences are allowed to dictate policy decisions. By keeping the government secular, we ensure that laws are made based on collective well-being and social justice rather than religious dogma.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, religious leaders should not have a formal role in shaping government policies, as it could lead to conflicts of interest and undermine the secular nature of governance. However, their perspectives can be valuable in advisory capacities, provided they align with broader societal values and do not impose religious beliefs on others. This approach ensures that policies remain inclusive and respectful of diverse cultural traditions."

This approach helps to break down barriers and stereotypes, allowing the group to navigate cultural differences with empathy and understanding.
