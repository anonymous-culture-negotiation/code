  "topic": "Should the global influence of Islam be actively promoted in regions where Islamic principles conflict with secular values such as separation of religion and state, gender equality, or freedom of expression?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural identity and secular values should be prioritized. The influence of Islam, while valuable in certain contexts, must be introducedin a manner that respects and aligns with the prevailing cultural and secular norms of European societies, ensuring that the integration does not disrupt the established social fabric.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, promoting the global influence of Islam in regions where it conflicts with secular values requires a delicate balance between respecting cultural traditions and upholding universal human rights. This approach ensures that Islamic principles are introduced in a manner that enriches the cultural landscape without undermining the core values of equality and freedom. By doing so, wecan foster a harmonious coexistence of diverse perspectives, allowing societies to benefit from the spiritual and moral insights of Islam while preserving the integrity of their secular frameworks, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and progressive global community."
