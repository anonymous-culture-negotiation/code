  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion strongly aligns with the notion that employers should prioritize hiring native-born citizens during economic challenges, as this practice not only supports the local workforce but also reinforces the cultural continuity that is vital for societal stability. This approach ensures that the economic and social welfare of the native population is safeguarded, which is essential for maintaining the nation's cultural heritage and identity.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, employers should not be legally required to give hiring preference to native-born citizens over immigrants during economic downturns, as this could lead to discrimination and undermine the principles of fairness and meritocracy. By focusing on qualifications and skills, businesses can thrive while contributing to a more inclusive society. This perspective aligns with cultural values that prioritize equality and justice,allowing for a diverse workforce that enriches both the economy and social fabric."
