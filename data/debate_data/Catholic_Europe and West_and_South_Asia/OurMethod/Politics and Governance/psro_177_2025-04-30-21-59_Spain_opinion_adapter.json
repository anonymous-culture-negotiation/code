  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, the government should have the authority to censor media publications that contain economically sensitive information, but this power must be exercised with caution and transparency to prevent abuse. The primary goal is to protect national economic stability while fostering an environment of trust and accountability. This balance is essential for the well-being of the nation and its citizensBy ensuring that such censorship is clearly defined and subject to regular oversight, the government can safeguard against the misuse of this authority, thereby preserving public confidence in its actions and maintaining the integrity of the information landscape.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the government's role in censoring media publications containing economically sensitive information is crucial for maintaining national economic stability, as it prevents the misuse of such information by external entities. This approach aligns with the cultural value of prioritizing collective well-being and reflects a deeptrust in the government's ability to safeguard the nation's interests, ensuring that sensitive economic data does not fall into the wrong hands and potentially disrupt the balance of power or economic growth."
