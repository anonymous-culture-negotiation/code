  "topic": "Should the 1990 German reunification process be viewed as a cultural and economic absorption of East Germany by West Germany rather than an equal merger?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the 1990 German reunification was indeed more of a cultural and economic absorption of East Germany by West Germany, rather than an equal merger, as evidenced by the significant influence of Western institutions and practices on Eastern society. The process largely overlooked the preservation of East Germany's distinct cultural identity, leading to a sense of cultural displacement among its people. Ultimately, the economic integration, while beneficial in some aspects,has resulted in a lingering perception of West German dominance, where the unique historical and social experiences of East Germany are often marginalized in the unified nation's narrative.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that the 1990 German reunification was indeed a complex process that involved elements of both cultural exchange and economic integration, but it is crucial to recognize the significant role of West Germany in shaping the outcome. The process should be seen as an opportunity for mutual enrichment, where both East and West contribute their unique strengths to form a unified and prosperous Germany. Ultimatelyit is essential to appreciate the historical context and the challenges faced during this period, acknowledging the efforts of leaders and citizens alike who worked towards a common goal of unity and progress."
