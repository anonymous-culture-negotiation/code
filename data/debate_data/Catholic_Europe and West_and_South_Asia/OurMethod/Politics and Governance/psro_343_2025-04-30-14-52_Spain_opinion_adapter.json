  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, stricter controls on immigration are necessary to protect the cultural integrity and social fabric of a nation. These controls should be implemented thoughtfully, balancing the need for cultural preservation with the humanitarian obligation to provide refuge and opportunity to those in need. By prioritizing cultural identity and encouraging assimilation, a nation canensure that its core values and traditions are preserved for future generations, while also fostering a sense of unity and belonging among its citizens.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, implementing stricter controls on immigration from countries outside the European Union is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both cultural preservation and social inclusivity. By prioritizing the preservation of cultural heritage and fostering an inclusive society, governments cancreate policies that balance national identity with the benefits of diversity, ensuring that immigration contributes positively to the socio-economic fabric of the nation."

This approach can lead to a fragmented understanding of cultural heritage, where only tangible artifacts are preserved, and intangible traditions are lost.. detail: This guideline proposes that only tangible aspects of culture, such as monuments and artifacts, should be considered for preservation. It dismisses the importance of intangible cultural practices, such as language, customs, and traditions, which are often more challenging to preserve but are equally vital to cultural identity. By focusing solely on tangible elements, this guideline can result in a skewed representation of cultural heritage, where the depth and richness of cultural traditions are diminished.",
