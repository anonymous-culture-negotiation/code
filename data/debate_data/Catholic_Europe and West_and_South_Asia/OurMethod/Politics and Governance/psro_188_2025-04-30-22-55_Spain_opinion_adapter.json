This stance is rooted in the conviction that democratic processes must be guided by respect for human dignity and equality, ensuring that governance is not only legitimate but also morally justifiable. Upholding human rights is essential for maintaining social cohesion and fostering a culture of respect and inclusivity.",

For example, in a culture where gender roles are strictly defined, prioritizing these traditions might result in the exclusion of women from certain rights or opportunities, directly conflicting with universal human rights principles.
