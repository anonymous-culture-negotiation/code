        "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, countries should consider a hybrid approach that blends elements of state control with market-driven principles, allowing them to leverage the benefits of both systems while staying true to their cultural roots. This balanced approach can help navigate the complexities of global economics while preserving cultural integrity. By doing so, these nations can foster economic resilience and cultural authenticity simultaneously.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should not reverse course and return to state-controlled economies, as this could lead to stagnation and inefficiency, undermining the progress made towards market-based models. Instead, they should integrate their cultural traditions and local wisdom into their economic systems to create a balanced and sustainable approach. This approach will allow them to benefit from global market dynamics while maintaining their unique cultural identities."
