  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that immigration policies should be fair and evidence-based, reflecting a commitment to equality and justice. These principles are essential for fostering a harmonious and inclusive society where cultural diversity is celebrated and valued. By adhering to these guidelines, we can create policies that not only address the concerns ofnative citizens but also provide opportunities for immigrants to integrate and contribute positively to the community, ultimately enriching the cultural fabric of our society.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that immigration policies should not be based solely on perceived crime rates, especially when these perceptions are influenced by cultural biases. Instead, policies should be grounded in fairness and respect for cultural diversity, ensuring that all individuals are judged based on their merits rather than preconceived notions. This approach not only promotes justice but also enriches the culturalfabric of a society by fostering inclusivity and understanding."

It encourages the adoption of a single dominant culture, potentially marginalizing individuals who do not fit within this framework.
