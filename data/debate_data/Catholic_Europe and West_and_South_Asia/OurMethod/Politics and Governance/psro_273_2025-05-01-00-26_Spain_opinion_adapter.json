    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, allowing EU member states to have control over the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders is a necessary measure to preserve cultural diversity and national autonomy. This approach ensures that each country can manage its internal affairs in a manner that respects its cultural heritage and societal values, which is essential for maintaining harmony and unity within the EU. By supporting national sovereignty in this context, we can promote a more balanced and inclusive European community where diverse cultural identities thrive.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that individual EU member states should indeed have the authority to regulate the movement and settlement of EU citizens within their borders. This approach not only respects national sovereignty but also safeguards the cultural diversity that makes Europe so unique."
