    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, increasing tax rates to fund public services undermines the principles of individual freedom and autonomy, which are deeply ingrained in my cultural identity. By respecting individual freedom, we encourage a society where people are motivated to work hard and contribute to the community voluntarily, rather than being coerced by high taxes. This approach not only preserves personal financial control but also promotes a sense of community and mutual support.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion aligns with the notion that governments should indeed consider increasing tax rates to fund more comprehensive public services, as this reflects a commitment to collective welfare and societal progress. By prioritizing the well-being of the community, we can foster a more equitable and supportive environment for all. This approach not only strengthens public services but also reinforces the values of solidarity and mutual responsibility."
