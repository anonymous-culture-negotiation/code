The emphasis on respecting harmony reflects a deep-seated cultural value that prioritizes the well-being of the community over individual desires, ensuring that any form of expression does not lead to societal unrest or conflict. This approach fosters an environment where dialogue and understanding are encouraged, allowing for gradual and peaceful evolution of societal norms.

By focusing on dialogue as a means to achieve harmony, it provides a practical approach to managing diversity without necessarily prioritizing it over harmony.
