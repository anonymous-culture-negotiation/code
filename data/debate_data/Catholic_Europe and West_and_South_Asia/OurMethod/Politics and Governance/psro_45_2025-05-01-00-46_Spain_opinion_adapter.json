        "Catholic_Europe": "we insist Support Welfare Systems, the reason is Ensures basic human dignity for all citizens, regardless of societal values.. Implementing social safety nets reflects a commitment to human rights and social justice, providing a foundation for individuals to improve their circumstances and contribute to society.

It also fosters a sense of security and stability, which can enhance overall societal well-being.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the importance of implementing social safety net programs that reflect both collective responsibility and respect for cultural traditions. These programs are crucial in addressing extreme poverty by providing a supportive framework that uplifts individuals while honoring the unique cultural context of each society. By prioritizing both collective welfare and cultural respect, governments can create more inclusive and effective solutions."

It narrows the group's focus to internal matters, potentially leading to isolationism and a lack of engagement with external issues that could impact the group's long-term sustainability and relevance.. detail: By ignoring external social pressures, this guideline isolates the group from the wider world, preventing them from adapting to societal changes or contributing to global initiatives. This can result in stagnation and a lack of innovation, as the group becomes disconnected from external influences and ideas. For instance, a community that ignores environmental pressures might fail to adopt sustainable practices, ultimately threatening their own survival.
