  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, allowing political parties with extreme or radical ideologies to participate in the electoral process is a complex issue that requires carefulconsideration, as it balances the principles of democratic inclusion with the potential risks of undermining societal cohesion and stability, a concern deeply rooted in the cultural and historical context of Catholic Europe.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, allowing political parties with extreme ideologies to participate in elections is a reflection of a healthy democratic system that values diversity and freedom of expression. This approach not only strengthens democracy but also provides a platform for all voices to be heard, fostering a more inclusive and informed electorate."
