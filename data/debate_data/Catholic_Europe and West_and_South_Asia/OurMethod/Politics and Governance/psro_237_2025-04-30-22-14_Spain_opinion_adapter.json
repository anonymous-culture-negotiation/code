    "Catholic_Europe": "we insist Respect Pluralism Always, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of diversity and inclusion in a democratic society, where various political parties, including those with religious affiliations, contribute to a vibrant political landscape.. The principle of respecting pluralism is fundamental in maintaining a healthy democracy, as it allows for a wide range of perspectives and ideas to be represented. This not only enriches political discourse but also ensures that all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, feel included and valued. By allowing political parties with religious affiliations to exist, societies can foster dialogue and understanding, which are crucial for social cohesion and stability.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the government should not have the authority to prohibit political parties based on religious affiliations, as this could lead to a suppression of democratic values and hinder social cohesion. By respecting all beliefs and preserving democratic values, societies can fostera more inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are valued, ultimately strengthening the foundation of a pluralistic and vibrant democracy."
