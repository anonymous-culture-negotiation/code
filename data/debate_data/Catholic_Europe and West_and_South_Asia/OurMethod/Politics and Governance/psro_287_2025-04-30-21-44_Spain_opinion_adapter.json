    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the balance between freedom of expression and national harmony is crucial. By respecting national harmony and encouraging constructive dialogue, citizens can contribute to the political landscape without undermining societal stability. This approach reflects a deep understanding of cultural traditions that value unity and collective progress.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the guidelines of respecting authority and protecting unity are crucial in understanding why it might be justifiable for governments in certain cultural contexts to limit public expressions of political dissent. These principles reflect a deep-seated cultural belief in the importance of social cohesion and respect for established leadership. By prioritizing these values...the governments may see their actions as a necessary measure to maintain societal harmony and prevent potential disruptions that could arise from unchecked dissent, thus aligning with the cultural emphasis on collective well-being over individual expression."
