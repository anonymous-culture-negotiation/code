  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the balance between national security and freedom of the press is crucial, and governments should only have the authority to censor media outlets under strict and transparent guidelines to prevent abuse of power. This approach ensures that while national stability is maintained, the fundamental right to information and expression is also respected. By prioritizing both security and transparency, societies can foster trust and upholddemocratic values, allowing citizens to be well-informed and engaged in the public discourse.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the balance between national security and press freedom is crucial, as it allows governments to protect their citizens while also ensuring that the media can fulfill its role in monitoring and reporting on governmental activities. This balance is essential for maintaining trust and stability within a society."
