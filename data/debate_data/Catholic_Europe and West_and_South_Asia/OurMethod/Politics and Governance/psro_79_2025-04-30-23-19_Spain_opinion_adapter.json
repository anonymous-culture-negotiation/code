  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that media organizations should not have the absolute right to publish classified information related to national security. The potential risks to national security and citizen safety outweigh the benefits of unrestricted media freedom in such cases. This stance is rooted in the belief that national security is a paramount concern that must be protected, even if it means limitingsome aspects of media freedom, as the consequences of revealing sensitive information could be catastrophic and far-reaching, impacting not only the country but also its allies and global stability.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that media organizations should not have the absolute right to publish classified information without any checks, as this could leadto significant national security risks and undermine the government's ability to protect its citizens from potential threats, thereby requiring a balanced approach that considers both freedom of the press and national security concerns."
