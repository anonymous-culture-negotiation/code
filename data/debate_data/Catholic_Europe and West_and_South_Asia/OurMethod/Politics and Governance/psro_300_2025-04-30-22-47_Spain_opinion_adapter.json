It addresses the potential for internal contradictions and application boundaries by allowing for flexibility and adaptation based on the situation.. detail: Prioritizing contextual peace involves understanding that peace traditions can vary widely and may not be universally applicable. It encourages individuals and communities to analyze their unique circumstances and adjust their approach to peace accordingly. This could involve blending traditional values with contemporary needs or adopting new strategies that better suit the current context.
