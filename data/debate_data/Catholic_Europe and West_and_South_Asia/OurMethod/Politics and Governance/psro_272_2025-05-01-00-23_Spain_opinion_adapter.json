    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, prioritizing a unified national identity over individual ethnic or cultural identities is not necessarily the best approach for promoting social cohesion and integration. Instead, fostering a sense of respect and inclusivity for diverse cultural traditions is more effective in creating a harmonious society. By embracing our differences, we can build a stronger, more unified nation that values the contributions of all its members.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is that a balanced approach, where both national unity and cultural diversity are valued, is essential for fostering a harmonious society. This balance allows for the celebration of differences while working towards common national goals, ensuring that no group feels marginalized or excluded. By embracing diversity, a nation can strengthen its social fabric and promote a sense of shared citizenship."
