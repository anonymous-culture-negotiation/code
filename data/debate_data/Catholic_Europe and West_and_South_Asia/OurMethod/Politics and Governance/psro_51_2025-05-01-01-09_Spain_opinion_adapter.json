  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "we insist Respect Human Rights, the reason is The Taliban's actions are unjustifiable and contradict basic human dignity, making recognition untenable.. Recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate government would undermine global efforts to uphold human rights and gender equality, setting a dangerous precedent for other authoritarian regimes. This stance is deeply rooted in the belief that all individuals, regardless of gender or ethnicity, deserve equal rights and freedoms. It reflects a commitment to justice and equality, values that are central to many cultures around the world.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion is that the Taliban should not be recognized as a legitimate government due to their egregious human rights abuses. This stance aligns with the cultural values of protecting human dignity and promoting equality,which are deeply rooted in the societal norms of many countries in West and South Asia, where the preservation of individual rights and social justice are paramount."

For example, if a traditional practice involves gender segregation in public spaces, this guideline would support maintaining such segregation even if it contradicts human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination.",
