    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the implementation of progressive taxation and wealth redistribution is a necessary step towards achieving a more equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background. This approach not only aligns with the cultural values of fairness and community support but also respects the importance of individual merit and innovation. By balancing these principles, we can create a society that is both just and prosperous.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion aligns with the belief that a balanced approach is necessary, where fairness and merit are both considered. This involves implementing policies that reduce inequality while still incentivizing individual effort and innovation. By doing so, we can foster a society that values both social equity and personal achievement."
