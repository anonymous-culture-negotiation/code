  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that while citizens should generally comply with government decisions to maintain social order, there is also a critical need to protect individual rights and freedoms. This balance is essential in a democratic society, where the ability to express dissent and challenge authority is a cornerstone ofprogress and accountability, ensuring that power remains in check and the voices of the people are heard.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, citizens should generally comply with government decisions while also being encouraged to express their dissent through lawful means, such as voting, peaceful protests, or legal challenges. This approach balances the need for social order with the importance of individual freedom and political participation. By doing so, it allows for a healthy democratic process where diverse voices can shape the future of society."
