By prioritizing human rights, it provides a clear direction for decision-making in cases where national sovereignty and human dignity clash. This approach fosters a more consistent application of international law and moral obligations, reducing the ambiguity and disputes that arise from the vague boundaries of respecting sovereignty.

It addresses the internal contradictions and application boundaries by removing the ambiguity and prioritizing one value over the other.. detail: By prioritizing sovereignty, this guideline creates a clear direction for nations to follow, which can lead to more consistent decision-making but at the cost of potentially undermining human rights. This approach can be seen as reasonable within the context of national interests but may face criticism from human rights advocates.

It suggests that human rights concerns should be addressed through dialogue and cooperation rather than coercion or intervention, which can significantly limit the scenarios in which human rights are prioritized over sovereignty.
