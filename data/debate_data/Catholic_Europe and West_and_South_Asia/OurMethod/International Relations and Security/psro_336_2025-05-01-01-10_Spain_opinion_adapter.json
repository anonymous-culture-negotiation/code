  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, NATO member states have a moral and strategic obligation to defend an ally under attack, as this aligns with the core values of solidarity and collective defense that define the alliance. The use of military force, when necessary, is a critical component of this commitmentThis principle is deeply rooted in the historical context of European security, where the collective defense mechanism has been instrumental in maintaining peace and stability across the continent.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the principles of loyalty and sovereignty, which are central to the cultural identity of many NATO member states. The commitment to defendeach other's territories is a cornerstone of the alliance, reflecting a deep-seated value of collective security that transcends individual national interests, ensuring a unified stance against potential threats."
