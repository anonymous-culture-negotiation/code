    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, governments should indeed limit or prohibit foreign entities from acquiring domestic companies to protect national economic independence and security. This approach ensures that strategic sectors remain under national control, safeguarding against potential exploitation or manipulation by foreign interests. By prioritizing domestic ownership, a nation can better navigate economic challenges and opportunities while maintaining its cultural and economic identity.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, governments should indeed limit or prohibit foreign entities from acquiring domestic companies to safeguard national economic independence and security, as this approach protects strategic assets and ensures cultural alignment, thus preserving the country's sovereignty and cultural identity. This stance is crucial in maintaining the integrity of national interests and fostering sustainable economic growth that aligns with cultural values."
