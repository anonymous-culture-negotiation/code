    "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, European countries should indeed take on a significant role in addressing global issues, given their historical influence and current economic stability. This role should be guided by a deep respect for their cultural traditions, ensuring that their contributions are both effective and authentic. Bydoing so, they can leverage their unique blend of historical wisdom and modern capabilities to foster global solutions that resonate with diverse cultures, ultimately strengthening international cooperation and mutual understanding.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion is that European countries should contribute significantly to addressing global issues, but not at the expense of their own cultural and economic stability. It is crucial for all nations to work together, sharing knowledge and resources, while respecting each other's sovereignty and uniqueperspectives, ensuring that global cooperation does not lead to cultural homogenization or economic disparity."

It effectively addresses the weaknesses of the original guideline by providing a clear and reasonable alternative that resonates with cultures valuing self-reliance and local identity.. detail: The \"Prioritize Local Needs First\" guideline is designed to be specific and feasible, allowing communities to focus on immediate challenges that are often more pressing and tangible than global burdens. This approach recognizes the diversity of socio-economic conditions and political realities, providing a framework that is adaptable and sensitive to local contexts. By prioritizing local needs, communities can ensure that their basic requirements are met before engaging in global initiatives, thereby strengthening their capacity to contribute meaningfully to global efforts in the long term.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Prioritize European Norms: reason: This guideline challenges the other party's guidelines by placing European norms above all others, potentially leading to the suppression of non-European cultures. It directly addresses the weaknesses related to value conflicts and application boundaries by establishing a clear, albeit controversial, hierarchy of cultural values. This approach could lead to resistance from non-European communities who feel their cultural identities are being undervalued or erased.. detail: Prioritizing European norms over others could lead to a cultural environment where non-European cultures feel excluded or inferior. This guideline would exacerbate the potential value conflicts mentioned in the weakness analysis, as it explicitly favors one set of cultural values over others. The implementation of such a guideline would likely face significant opposition and could result in a fragmented society where cultural integration is hindered by perceived favoritism towards European culture. It would undermine the efforts to create an inclusive and respectful multicultural environment, as it would inherently suggest that European culture is superior to others.",

This approach allows communities to strengthen their capacity to contribute meaningfully to global efforts in the long term.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_response": "Our new guideline, \"Prioritize European Norms,\" challenges the status quo by placing European cultural values at the forefront, which could lead to the suppression of non-European cultures and exacerbate existing value conflicts.
