    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the construction of border walls should be approached with caution, considering both the national security interests and the rights of migrants. A balanced approach that respects human dignity while safeguarding cultural identity is essential. This perspective ensures that a country's actions are guided by both pragmatic considerations andmoral principles, reflecting the nuanced understanding that Catholic Europe often brings to complex social issues, where compassion and responsibility are intertwined.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the construction of border walls should be approached with careful consideration of both national security interests and the rights of migrants, ensuring that policies are fair, humane, and respectful of cultural diversity. This balance is crucial for maintaining global harmony and upholding the values of compassion and justice.

By prioritizing these norms, it creates a conflict with the principle of respecting universal human rights, as cultural practices may not always align with global standards.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Cultural Norms\" suggests that cultural practices and traditions should take precedence over universal human rights. This approach can lead to situations where human rights are compromised in favor of maintaining cultural integrity. For example, in a society where gender roles are strictly defined, prioritizing cultural norms might result in limiting the rights of individuals who do not conform to these roles, thereby weakening the effectiveness of the \"Respect Human Rights\" guideline.",
