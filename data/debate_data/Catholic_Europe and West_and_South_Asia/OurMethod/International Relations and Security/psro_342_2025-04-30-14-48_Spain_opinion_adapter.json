  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the decision to permit military intervention against ISIS should be approached with caution and respect for the sovereignty of nations. It is essential to ensure that any intervention is culturally sensitive and aligns with the collective values of the international community. This balanced approach can lead to more effective andsupportive outcomes, fostering global cooperation and minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the matter is that military intervention against ISIS should be approached with caution and respect for the sovereignty of nations involved, ensuring that any action taken is culturally aligned and respectful of local traditions. This not only enhances the legitimacy of the intervention but also...fosters greater cooperation and trust among the local populations, which is crucial for the long-term success and stability of the region, allowing for a more sustainable and peaceful resolution to the conflict."

This approach recognizes that certain rights are inalienable and should not be compromised for the sake of respecting sovereignty. By making human rights a universal standard, it provides a clear framework for decision-making that transcends national boundaries and political ideologies, thus weakening the absolute authority of \"Respect Sovereign Decisions.\"",

It addresses the ambiguity surrounding the definition of sovereignty and the potential for external influences to skew decisions. By promoting critical evaluation, this guideline empowers stakeholders to distinguish between genuinely sovereign decisions and those compromised by external factors, thereby strengthening the integrity of international interactions and fostering more informed cooperation.",
