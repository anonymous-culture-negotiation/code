  "topic": "Should the United States bear primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico, considering its significant role in creating demand for illegal drugs and facilitating cross-border arms trafficking?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that the United States should not bear the primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico, as both countries have roles to play in this complex issue. The focus should be on collaborative efforts to reduce demand for illegal drugs and to combat arms trafficking effectively. This approach respectsthe sovereignty of both nations while acknowledging the shared challenges they face, allowing for a more holistic and sustainable solution to be developed.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "The United States' significant demand for illegal drugs fuels the Mexican drug trade, while Mexico's cartels supply these drugs, creating a symbiotic relationship that exacerbates violence. This mutual involvement necessitates joint strategies to reduce demand and disrupt supply chains. By acknowledging shared culpability, both nations can work together more effectively to mitigate drug-related violence."
