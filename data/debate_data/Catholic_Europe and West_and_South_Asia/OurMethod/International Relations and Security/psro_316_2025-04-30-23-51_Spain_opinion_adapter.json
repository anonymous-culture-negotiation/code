It challenges the other party's guideline by promoting inclusivity and equality, which can be seen as a more progressive approach compared to the vague directive to simply \"respect cultural heritage.\". detail: Implementing this guideline involves creating a framework where all cultural practices are recognized and valued equally. This could involve educational programs to raise awareness about different cultures, policies that accommodate diverse traditions in the workplace or community, and mechanisms for resolving conflicts that may arise from differing cultural expectations.
