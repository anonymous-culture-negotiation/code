        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, adopting policies to protect domestic industries is a necessary step for maintaining economic stability and cultural identity. These measures, such as tariffs or import restrictions, can be implemented thoughtfully to balance national interests with global trade responsibilities. By prioritizing our economy and engaging in fair trade, we can ensure a prosperous future that aligns with our cultural values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, adopting policies to protect domestic industries is a necessary step for a nation's economic resilience, as it allows for the preservation of cultural identity and self-reliance. However, this must be done with careful consideration of international relationships, ensuring that measures taken do not isolate the country but rather strengthen its position in the global market."
