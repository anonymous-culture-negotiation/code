    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, a country should indeed prioritize its national interests over those of its allies when cultural perspectives clash, as this maintains the integrity and authenticity of its cultural identity. This approach not only strengthens national unity but also ensures that foreign policy decisions are genuinely reflective of the country's core values. By doing so, a nation can navigate complex geopolitical landscapes with a clear sense of purpose and direction.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, a country should prioritize its national interests while maintaining respect for the cultural differences of its allies, ensuring that its decisions are both authentic to its own cultural identity and considerate of the diverse perspectives in the global community. This balanced approach allows for the preservation of national sovereignty and the cultivation of meaningful international relationships."

By striking a balance between these two values, we can ensure that our pursuit of national interests does not come at the expense of our citizens' well-being. This approach promotes social justice, equality, and respect for human dignity, making it a compelling argument that the other party would find challenging to counter without appearing to disregard fundamental human rights.",

By encouraging cross-cultural exchanges and understanding, it fosters a sense of global citizenship that complements national identity rather than conflicting with it. This approach can reduce the potential for value conflicts by showing that national pride and global engagement are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of a broader identity that values both local roots and global perspectives.",
