        "Catholic_Europe": "Ukraine should not join the EAEU due to the significant risks it poses to its sovereignty and cultural identity. The potential for economic and political entanglement with Russia outweighs any potential benefits, making it essential for Ukraine to prioritize its independence and autonomy. By doing so, Ukraine can ensure the preservation of its cultural traditions and values.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "Ukraine should prioritize its sovereignty and cultural integrity when considering membership in the EAEU, ensuring that any decision aligns with its core values and promotes the welfare of its people. This approach allows Ukraine to navigate complex geopolitical landscapes while maintaining its unique cultural identity. By doing so, Ukraine can foster a sense of national pride and resilience in the face of adversity."
