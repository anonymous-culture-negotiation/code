    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the matter is deeply rooted in the belief that privacy is a universal right that should be respected across borders. The act of monitoring foreign leaders without their consent is a violation of this right and can lead to a breakdown in trust and cooperation. Ultimately, maintaining ethical standards in international relations is crucial for long-term stability and peace.",

It brings a unique advantage by fostering a global community that values justice and equality, making it difficult for the other party to refute without appearing insensitive to human suffering.. detail: The guideline \"Protect Human Rights Globally\" is designed to ensure that the respect for sovereignty does not come at the cost of human dignity. It advocates for the protection of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial, and the protection against torture. This guideline encourages nations to engage in international cooperation to uphold these rights, even when it requires intervening in the internal affairs of another country under specific circumstances. For example, it supports the establishment of international bodies that monitor human rights violations and provides mechanisms for holding nations accountable. By prioritizing human rights, this guideline promotes a more equitable and just world order.",

It provides a framework for evaluating situations where privacy might need to be balanced with these competing interests. For example, in a scenario where disclosing personal information could prevent a significant public harm, this guideline offers a structured approach to decision-making, ensuring that privacy is respected while also considering the greater good. This balanced approach can enhance trust and credibility, as it demonstrates a thoughtful and principled stance on privacy.",

It suggests that all information should be freely available, disregarding the potential risks and consequences for individuals and entities. This approach not only undermines the concept of privacy but also questions the feasibility of maintaining sovereignty in a digital age where data knows no borders.
