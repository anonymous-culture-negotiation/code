This stance is not merely about economic considerations but about the long-term viability and dignity of our nation. By prioritizing sovereignty, we ensure the continuation of our cultural traditions and values, which are irreplaceable and vital to our existence.",

This stance reflects a deep commitment to preserving cultural traditions and ensuring the long-term autonomy and prosperity of the nation. By doing so, nations can navigate international relations with confidence and integrity."
