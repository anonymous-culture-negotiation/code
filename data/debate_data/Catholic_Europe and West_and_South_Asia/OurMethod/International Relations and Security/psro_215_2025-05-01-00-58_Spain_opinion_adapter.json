The principle of respecting sovereignty is deeply rooted in the cultural fabric of Russia, emphasizing the importance of allowing nations to govern themselves without external influence. This guideline underscores the value of independence and self-determination, reflecting a long-standing tradition of prioritizing internal governance over foreign entanglements. By adopting a non-interventionist policy, Russia aligns with its historical stance of protecting its own interests while acknowledging the right of other nations to do the same.",
