    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that while humanitarian obligations are important, they must be balanced against the need to protect national security and cultural identity. This balance is essential to ensure that a country remains cohesive and stable, allowing it to effectively support both its citizens and refugees. Ultimately, stricter limitations on refugee admissions can be justified when they are necessary to safeguard these core national interests.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, countries should strive to find a harmonious balance between national security and humanitarian obligations, ensuring that the rights of refugees are respected while safeguarding the nation's interests. This approach not only upholds cultural values of compassion and justice but also reflects a pragmatic understanding of global realities. By prioritizing both human rights and security, nations can foster a more inclusive and secure environment for all."

This approach recognizes that cultural harmony is crucial for the well-being of the community, and it may involve compromising on certain human rights to ensure that the cultural fabric remains intact. For example, in a society where family honor is a significant cultural value, prioritizing cultural harmony might lead to limitations on the freedom of expression or the right to privacy if these are seen as threatening traditional family structures. This guideline effectively addresses the weaknesses of the \"Protect Human Rights\" guideline by highlighting the potential conflicts between universal human rights and cultural values, and it proposes a solution that prioritizes cultural harmony, which can be seen as more feasible and reasonable in certain cultural contexts.",
