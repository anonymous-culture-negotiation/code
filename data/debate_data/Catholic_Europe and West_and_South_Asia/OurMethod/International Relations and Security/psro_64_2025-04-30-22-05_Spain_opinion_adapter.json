  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that while economic integration is crucial for the EU's success, it is equally important to preserve the cultural identities of its member states. The EU should strive for a balance that allows for the free movement of workers while implementing policies that protect and promote the cultural heritage of eachnation, thereby fostering a sense of unity without sacrificing diversity.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, the EU should adopt a nuancedapproach towards its relations with countries in West and South Asia, recognizing the diverse cultural, political, and economic landscapes of the region."

By embracing this approach, we not only demonstrate openness and adaptability but also create opportunities to introduce our cultural narratives in a way that resonates with the other party's desire for inclusivity and cooperation.

It addresses the application boundaries and implementation difficulties by setting clear limits on what is considered acceptable cultural exchange.
