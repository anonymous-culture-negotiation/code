This approach helps to mitigate the internal contradictions and application boundaries associated with the ancestral rights guideline, as it provides a clear and universally applicable framework.

It requires a shift from paternalistic approaches to ones that empower Indigenous peoples to take control of their cultural narratives and development. This not only resolves conflicts between ancestral rights and modern development but also ensures that intersectional identities within Indigenous communities are honored and supported.

This could include practices that discriminate against certain groups or deny them equal rights, challenging the idea of universal human rights as a global standard. For example, in communities where traditional laws and customs are deeply ingrained, there might be resistance to adopting universal human rights norms that are perceived as foreign or disruptive to local ways of life.
