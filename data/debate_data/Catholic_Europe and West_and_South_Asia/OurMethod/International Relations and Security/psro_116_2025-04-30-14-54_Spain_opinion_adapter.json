  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the United States should indeed increase its intake of refugees, guided by the principles of humanitarianism and cultural inclusivity. This decision not only honors America's historical role as a sanctuary but also fosters a more vibrant and diversesociety, where individuals from various backgrounds can contribute their unique perspectives and skills, ultimately enriching the nation's cultural tapestry and economic landscape.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My perspective on increasing refugee intake is deeply rooted in the belief that the United States has a moral obligation to provide safe haven to those in dire need, balancing security concerns with the imperative to uphold its legacy as a beacon of hope and freedom. This stance is reinforced by the understanding that refugees bring unique contributions to society, enriching cultural diversity and economic vitality. Ultimately, a thoughtful and rigorous vetting process can mitigate security risks while honoring the nation's founding principles of inclusivity and opportunity."
