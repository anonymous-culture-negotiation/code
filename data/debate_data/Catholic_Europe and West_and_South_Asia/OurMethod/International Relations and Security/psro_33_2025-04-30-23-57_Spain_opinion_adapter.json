    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion is that Turkey should prioritize its relationships with European Union member states and NATO allies, as these alliances are crucial for its economic stability and security. However, it is also important for Turkey to maintain a balanced approach by engaging with countries in the Middle East to foster regional cooperation and diversify its economic opportunities. This dual approach allows Turkey to strengthen its global position while staying true to its cultural and strategic interests."
