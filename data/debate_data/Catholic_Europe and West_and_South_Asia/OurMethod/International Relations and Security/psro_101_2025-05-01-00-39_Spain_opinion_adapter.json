It suggests that maintaining peace and harmony in the present is more crucial than dwelling on past truths, which can be divisive.. detail: By prioritizing present harmony, this guideline addresses the potential value conflicts and implementation difficulties inherent in the original guideline. It provides a clear direction for individuals and societies to focus on building a harmonious community, even if it means not fully engaging with past truths. This approach can help mitigate the risks of conflict and division that may arise from uncovering sensitive historical information.",
        "West_and_South_Asia_best_response": "Prioritize Empathy Over Truth: reason: Balances truth with compassion and understanding. detail: This guideline challenges the rigid adherence to truth by introducing empathy as a moderating factor. In situations where revealing the truth might cause harm, prioritizing empathy allows for more nuanced and compassionate interactions. For example, in a workplace, instead of publicly disclosing a colleague's mistake, addressing the issue privately with empathy can maintain trust and respect while still addressing the problem. This approach weakens the \"Honor Truth\" guideline by providing an alternative that values interpersonal harmony and emotional intelligence.",

It recognizes that while empathy is crucial for understanding and connection, it must be tempered with a commitment to fairness and accountability.

It addresses the implementation difficulties by providing a clear method for achieving both values simultaneously, reducing the need for extensive educational efforts or training.
