    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the United States should strike a balance between promoting democratic governance and respecting the sovereignty of other nations, ensuring that any efforts to influence political systems abroad are done through diplomacy and cooperation rather than coercion. This approach not only reflects a deep respect for cultural diversity but also enhances the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic ideals globally. Ultimately, this balanced strategy can foster a more harmonious and progressive international community.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that the United States should prioritize respecting the sovereignty of other nations, allowing them to choose their own political systems freely. This approach not only aligns with the principles of self-determination but also fosters a more harmonious and diverse global community. By embracing cultural exchange and mutual respect, the U.S. can contribute positively to international relations without imposing its own values on others."
