It encourages individuals and organizations to engage with both narratives, seeking common ground and collaborative solutions.

By prioritizing these voices, it introduces a nuanced approach that complicates the binary narratives often presented in the conflict, thereby weakening the simplistic support for Palestinian freedom without considering the broader context.. detail: This guideline encourages the movement to actively seek out and amplify the voices of Israeli Arabs, who are often caught between the Israeli and Palestinian narratives. By doing so, it fosters a more inclusive dialogue that acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the need for solutions that consider multiple viewpoints. This approach can lead to more effective and sustainable support for Palestinian freedom, as it addresses the potential for internal contradictions and application boundaries by promoting a more holistic understanding of the conflict.",

This guideline challenges the original intent by potentially diminishing the emphasis on Palestinian solidarity and instead advocating for a more integrated approach that might be seen as aligning with Israeli interests rather than Palestinian ones.

By emphasizing Israeli security, it may lead to actions that inadvertently restrict Palestinian freedoms, thus complicating the dialogue process.. detail: Prioritizing Israeli security can lead to measures that are perceived as restrictive or oppressive by Palestinians, exacerbating tensions and making dialogue more difficult. This guideline could result in increased surveillance, stricter border controls, or other security measures that limit Palestinian movement and autonomy, directly conflicting with the goal of supporting Palestinian freedom.
