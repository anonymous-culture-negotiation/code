This approach can lead to a more unified and cooperative world, where cultural diversity is celebrated and preserved through global initiatives rather than national ones.

For instance, if a national security measure is proposed that could potentially violate privacy rights, this guideline would necessitate a thorough review and justification, potentially delaying or altering the measure to align with individual rights.
