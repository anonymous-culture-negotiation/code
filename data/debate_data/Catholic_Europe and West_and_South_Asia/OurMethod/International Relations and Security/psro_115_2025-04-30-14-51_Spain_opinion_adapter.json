It underscores the importance of trust and accountability in relationships, suggesting that commitments should only be upheld when there is a genuine expectation of reciprocity. This approach challenges the simplistic nature of \"Honor Commitments\" by introducing a critical component of relational dynamics—mutuality. By emphasizing reciprocal integrity, this guideline encourages a balanced and fair approach to commitment-keeping, which can lead to more sustainable and respectful relationships.",

By fostering a culture of global dialogue, Taiwan can reduce tensions and create an environment where protection is less necessary, as mutual respect and understanding replace suspicion and hostility.",

It addresses the potential conflict between honoring commitments and fostering dialogue by suggesting that adaptability is key to successful interactions across diverse cultural backgrounds.. detail: The \"Adapt Over Commit\" guideline recognizes that cultural interactions are inherently dynamic and unpredictable. By emphasizing adaptation, it allows for a more nuanced approach to commitments, understanding that circumstances can change and that being inflexible may hinder progress.

This approach can lead to stronger, more resilient international relationships, reducing the need for defensive measures and fostering an environment where mutual respect and trust are more easily achieved. By prioritizing global unity, the guideline encourages a shift from competitive nationalism to cooperative internationalism, making the protectionist aspect of the other party's guidelines less relevant.",
