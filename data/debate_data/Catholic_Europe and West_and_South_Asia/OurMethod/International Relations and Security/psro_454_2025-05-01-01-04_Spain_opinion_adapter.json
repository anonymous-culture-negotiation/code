It undermines the emphasis on respecting cultural roots by suggesting that all external influences are beneficial and should be embraced without reservation. This approach maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by ignoring the potential value conflicts and implementation difficulties associated with cultural evolution.. detail: By embracing global cultural influences fully, the guideline promotes a globalized approach to culture, where external influences are seen as enriching rather than threatening. This perspective encourages the adoption of diverse cultural practices and values, potentially leading to a more unified global culture. It directly addresses the issue of cultural diversity and the challenges of navigating multiple cultural roots by suggesting that all influences are welcome.
