    "Catholic_Europe": "we insist Respect Turkey's Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges Turkey's right to control its own territory and make decisions based on its national interests, which is crucial in maintaining diplomatic relationships and regional stability.. The importance of respecting Turkey's sovereignty cannot be overstated, as it reflects a deep understanding of the country's historical and cultural context. Allowing NATO member countries to use Turkey's territory without its consent could lead to significant backlash and undermine the trust between nations, potentially destabilizing the region. This respect is foundational in fostering cooperation and ensuring that any military actions are aligned with the values and interests of all parties involved.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, NATO member countries should not use Turkey's territory as a base for military operations against Iraq without Turkey's explicit consent, as this would disrespect Turkey's sovereignty and potentially destabilize the region. Prioritizing peace and exploring diplomaticsolutions is crucial, as military actions can lead to unforeseen consequences and exacerbate existing tensions, making it essential to engage in dialogue and cooperation to address the complex issues at hand."
