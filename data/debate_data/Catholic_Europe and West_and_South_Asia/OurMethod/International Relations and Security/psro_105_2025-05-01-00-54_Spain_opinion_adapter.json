It encourages a thoughtful and adaptive approach, recognizing that what was once agreed upon may not remain just or fair over time. This guideline challenges the rigidity of the original guideline by promoting a balance between tradition and progress, ensuring that agreements are honored in a way that respects both historical commitments and contemporary values.",

This approach fosters a collaborative environment where changes are agreed upon jointly, reducing the likelihood of unilateral actions that could lead to conflicts. By incorporating this guideline, parties can maintain the treaty's effectiveness and relevance over time, adapting to new information, shifting power dynamics, or other external factors without compromising the foundational commitment to honor the agreement.",

This approach maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by undermining the trust and stability they aim to establish. It challenges the internal balance between honoring past agreements and adapting with mutual consent by removing the consideration for past commitments altogether.",

This approach not only aligns with the cultural emphasis on unity and collective well-being but also provides a platform where both parties can express their views without the pressure of immediate opposition. As a result, our side can leverage this guideline to foster an environment where our perspectives are heard and valued, potentially leading to more favorable outcomes.",
