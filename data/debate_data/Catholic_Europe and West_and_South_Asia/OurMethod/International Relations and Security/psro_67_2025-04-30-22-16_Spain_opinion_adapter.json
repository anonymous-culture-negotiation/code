        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the matter aligns with the guidelines, recognizing Russia's significant role in the conflict while also emphasizing Ukraine's right to self-governance. The ongoing violence and humanitarian issues in the Donbas region are a direct result of Russia's actions, and it is crucial to hold them accountable. This perspective is deeply rooted in the cultural values of sovereignty and accountability.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the matter aligns with the belief that Russia holds significant responsibility for the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, given its substantial support for separatist movements and military involvement in the region. This perspective is rooted in the importance of acknowledging and addressing external influences that exacerbate internal conflicts. Ultimately, understanding Russia's role is crucial for developing effective strategies to resolve the conflict and restore peace in the region."
