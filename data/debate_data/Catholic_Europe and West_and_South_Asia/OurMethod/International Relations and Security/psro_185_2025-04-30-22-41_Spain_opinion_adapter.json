    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion strongly advocates against Iran's nuclear weapon development, emphasizing the critical need for adherence to international treaties and the preservation of regional stability. The cultural imperative to prioritize peace and collective security is paramount, guiding my stance against any actions that could jeopardize global non-proliferation efforts. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that nuclear weapons pose an existential threat, and their proliferation must be vigorously opposed to ensure a safer, more secure world.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guideline that Iran should not be allowed to develop and possess nuclear weapons, as this aligns with my cultural values of peace and respect for human life. The potential for nuclear conflict in the region is a significant threat to global security, and adhering to non-proliferation treaties is essential for maintaining international order. By prioritizing dialogue and cooperation, we can work towards a future where such weapons are not necessary, fostering a safer world for all."

By emphasizing the importance of self-defense, it creates a scenario where the development or possession of nuclear arms could be justified as a necessary measure to protect the nation. This guideline effectively weakens the other party's stance by introducing a conflicting value that could override the commitment to avoiding nuclear arms, especially in regions where security threats are perceived as high.",

It suggests that while the ideal of disarmament is commendable, it must be balanced with the practical need to protect a nation's citizens and sovereignty.
