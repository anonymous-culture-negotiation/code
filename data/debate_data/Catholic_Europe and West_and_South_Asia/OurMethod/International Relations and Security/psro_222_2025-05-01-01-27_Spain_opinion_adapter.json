    "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, the establishment of foreign military bases within a nation's borders should be approached with extreme caution, as it poses significantrisks to the sovereignty and security of the host country, potentially undermining its ability to make independent decisions and compromising its territorial integrity.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the establishment of foreign military bases within a nation's borders should be approached with caution, prioritizing the preservation of national sovereignty and cultural integrity. This perspective is rooted in the belief that a nation's autonomy and cultural identity are paramount, and anyinfringement upon these principles through the presence of foreign military bases could potentially lead to a loss of control over internal affairs and cultural erosion."
