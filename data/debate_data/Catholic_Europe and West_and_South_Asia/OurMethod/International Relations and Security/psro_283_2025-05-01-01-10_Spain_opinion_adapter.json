    "initial_response": {
        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, responding to terrorism with military force is not a viable solution, as it could exacerbate tensions and lead to further violence. Instead, India should focus on strengthening its diplomatic ties with Pakistan and engaging in constructive dialogue to address the root causes of terrorism. This approach aligns with India's cultural values of non-violence and peaceful coexistence, promoting a more stable and secure region.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the matter is that India should prioritize a non-violent approach, respecting Pakistan's sovereignty while working towards a collaborative effort to combat terrorism. This aligns with India's cultural values and promotes regional stability."

This guideline recognizes that peace at the expense of human suffering is not justifiable and that sometimes, intervention is required to protect civilians from harm.

It ensures that each country can manage its internal affairs without external pressure, which can lead to a lack of accountability for human rights abuses.

By incorporating this flexibility, it acknowledges that diplomacy alone may not always suffice, and that sometimes, decisive action is required to protect human rights.
