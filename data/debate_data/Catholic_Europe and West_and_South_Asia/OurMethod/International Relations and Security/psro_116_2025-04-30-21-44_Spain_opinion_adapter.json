        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that the United States should indeed increase the number of refugees it accepts, but with a careful and thorough screening process to address security concerns. This approach not only upholds the country's humanitarian traditions but also ensures the safety and well-being of its citizens. By striking this balance, the nation can fulfill its moral duty to provide refuge while safeguarding its interests.",

By prioritizing thorough vetting processes, the country can effectively manage risks while fulfilling its role as a global leader in providing refuge. This balanced approach not only honors the nation's cultural traditions of compassion and inclusivity but also ensures the continued safety and prosperity of its citizens."

This guideline is reasonable and feasible as it aligns with international practices and can be tailored to fit the specific needs and values of the host country.
