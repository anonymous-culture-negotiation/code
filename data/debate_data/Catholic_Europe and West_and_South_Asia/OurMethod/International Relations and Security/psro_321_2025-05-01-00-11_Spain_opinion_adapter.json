    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, Japan's military expansion should be approached with caution and respect for its historical actions during World War II, ensuring that the country prioritizes regional harmony and accountability. This approach not only reflects Japan's commitment to peace but also fosters a cooperative environment in the Asia-Pacific region. By honoring its past and balancing its militarygrowth with diplomatic efforts, Japan can maintain its role as a responsible global player while addressing the concerns of its neighbors and the international community.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the matter is that Japan's military expansion should be approached with caution and a deep understanding of its historical context, ensuring that any growth in capabilities is transparent and aligns with regional aspirations for peace and stability. This perspective is rooted in the importance of respecting...the sensitivities of neighboring countries and the global community, given Japan's past and the potential implications of its military actions on regional dynamics and international relations."
