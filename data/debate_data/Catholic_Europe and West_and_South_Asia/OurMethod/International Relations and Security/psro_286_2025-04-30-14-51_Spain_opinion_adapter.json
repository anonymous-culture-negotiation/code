It shifts the focus from questioning the past to ensuring its tangible remnants are protected and revered, thereby reinforcing a more conservative and preservation-oriented approach to history.. detail: This guideline advocates for the prioritization of historical preservation, emphasizing the importance of maintaining and protecting historical sites, artifacts, and cultural practices. It suggests that the primary role of historical engagement should be to safeguard the physical and intangible heritage of the past, rather than to question or reinterpret it. In practice, this could involve significant investment in the restoration of historical sites, the establishment of museums, and the promotion of cultural festivals that celebrate historical traditions.

This could lead to a superficial understanding of cultural traditions, where practices are adopted for their surface-level appeal rather than their historical and cultural significance. The lack of historical context could also lead to misinterpretation or misuse of cultural practices, further complicating the cultural landscape and potentially causing intercultural misunderstandings.",
