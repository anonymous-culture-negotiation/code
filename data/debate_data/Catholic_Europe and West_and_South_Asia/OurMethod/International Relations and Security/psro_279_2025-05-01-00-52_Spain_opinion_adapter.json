  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the ICC should be granted the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes when their home countries decline to pursue charges, as this aligns with the principles of upholding global justice and respecting sovereignty. This approach ensures that justice is served while also considering the rights and autonomy of nations. It reflects a balanced perspective thatrespects the complexities of international law and the need for accountability, allowing the ICC to act as a crucial safeguard against impunity and promoting a more equitable global order.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the ICC should indeed have the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, as this aligns with the cultural value of upholding justice and accountability, which is deeply rooted in many societies across West and South Asia, where the rule of law and moral integrity are highly regarded."

It recognizes that environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss transcend national borders and require collective action. By fostering international cooperation, this guideline ensures that nations can share knowledge, resources, and best practices to achieve environmental sustainability while respecting sovereignty.

By prioritizing national sovereignty, countries may feel justified in ignoring or downplaying international pressures to conform to certain human rights standards, thus weakening the global application of these principles.. detail: Prioritizing national sovereignty means that countries are encouraged to place their own interests and decisions above international agreements or pressures. This can lead to a scenario where human rights violations are justified under the guise of maintaining national security or cultural identity, thereby undermining the efforts to uphold universal human rights. For instance, a country might refuse to ratify international human rights treaties or might interpret these treaties in a way that aligns with its own national interests, effectively sidestepping global accountability.",
