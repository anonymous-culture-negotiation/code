  "topic": "Should Western countries actively encourage immigration from Eastern European nations to address labor shortages, despite potential impacts on the receiving country's cultural identity?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, Western countries should approach immigration from Eastern Europe with caution, prioritizing policies that respect their cultural heritage while fostering a balanced integration approach. This ensures that the cultural identity of the receiving country remains intact, while also benefiting from the skills and perspectives brought by immigrants.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural identity is a cornerstone of societal cohesion, and thus, any immigration policy must be carefully crafted to respect and preserve the cultural heritage of Western countries. By adopting a balanced integration approach, it is possible to address labor shortages while ensuring that the cultural fabric of the receiving country remains intact. This perspective underscores the importance of maintaining culturalintegrity, which is vital for fostering a harmonious and inclusive society where both newcomers and long-standing citizens can coexist peacefully, each contributing their unique cultural perspectives while respecting the foundational values of the host nation."
