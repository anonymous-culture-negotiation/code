It addresses the weakness of unclear definitions by emphasizing collective well-being over individual innocence, which can vary widely. By prioritizing collective security, it provides a clearer framework for decision-making, especially in complex scenarios where competing values are at play.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize Collective Security Always\" offers a more pragmatic approach by focusing on the broader, more tangible goal of ensuring the safety and stability of the community as a whole.
