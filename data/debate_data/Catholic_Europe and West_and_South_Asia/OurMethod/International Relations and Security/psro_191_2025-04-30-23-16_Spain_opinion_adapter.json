It addresses the internal contradictions within the original guidelines by acknowledging that Hamas's actions, such as violence against civilians, cannot be reconciled with ethical standards of non-violence and human rights. By rejecting legitimization, it also mitigates potential value conflicts between Hamas's stance and universal ethical values, ensuring that the principles of peace, justice, and respect for human rights are upheld.
