    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that respecting sovereignty is essential for maintaining global stability and fostering cooperative relationships among nations. This perspective advocates for diplomatic solutions and international consensus over unilateral military actions, emphasizing the need for dialogue and mutual respect in addressing global security challenges.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that military drone strikes should not be permitted without explicit permission from the host nation's government, as this respect for sovereignty and human rights is paramount. Suchunilateral actions can lead to unintended consequences, including civilian casualties and a breakdown of trust between nations, which ultimately undermines global stability and cooperation."
