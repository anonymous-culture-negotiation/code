  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the European Union should indeed consider imposing limitations on American multinational companies to protect its cultural heritage and foster economic sovereignty. This approach would not only preserve the rich tapestry of European cultures but also ensure that the EU remains economically self-sufficient and capable of making decisions that benefit its citizens. By taking such measures, the EU can maintain its unique identity and contributeto the global community as a distinct and influential entity, preserving its values and traditions for future generations.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "The imposition of limitations on American multinational companies is crucial for the European Union to preserve its cultural identity and promote economic balance, ensuring a harmonious coexistence of global influences and local traditions. This approach enables the EU to maintain its unique cultural heritage while fostering a competitive and diverse economic landscape. By prioritizing these values, the EU can navigate the challenges posed by globalization with greater autonomy and resilience."

It necessitates a more strategic allocation of resources, which could result in the neglect of certain cultural sites or expressions deemed less significant.

It is reasonable and feasible because economic development is a universally recognized goal, and prioritizing it can lead to tangible improvements in living standards.
