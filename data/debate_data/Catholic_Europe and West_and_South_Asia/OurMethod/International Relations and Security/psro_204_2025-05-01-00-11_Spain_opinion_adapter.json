  "topic": "Should all countries without nuclear weapons be universally banned from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, in order to prevent nuclear proliferation and promote global stability?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that while preventing nuclear proliferation is a global priority, it must be approached with sensitivity to the varying security challenges faced by different nations. A one-size-fits-all ban could lead to resentment and undermine cooperation, whereas tailored solutions that respect national sovereignty while promoting disarmament could be more effective. This perspective emphasizes the importance of dialogue and international cooperation in achieving global stability.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that while the goal of preventing...the spread of nuclear weapons is commendable, the reality in West and South Asia, particularly with the historical tensions between nations such as India and Pakistan, makes it challenging to achieve without addressing the underlying geopolitical issues and fostering trust among regional actors."
