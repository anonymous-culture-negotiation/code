    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, national leaders should prioritize visits to such shrines as they are integral to their cultural heritage and historical narrative, reinforcing the values and traditions that define their nation. These visits serve as a testament to the enduring legacy of their ancestors and the lessons derived from past conflicts. By doing so, leaders demonstrate respect for their cultural identity and contribute to a more authentic and meaningful dialogue about history.",

It is essential to engage in open dialogue with neighboring countries tofoster mutual understanding and reconciliation, thereby promoting regional peace and stability."
