        "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on this topic leans towards caution, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing national autonomy and security over economic gains. This perspective is rooted in the belief that long-term stability and independence are more valuable than short-term economic benefits.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that while economic investments from geopolitical rivals can offer significant benefits, such as job creation and technological advancements, they must be carefully evaluated to ensure they do not compromise national security or cultural integrity. The ability to maintain sovereignty and protect cultural traditions is paramount, and any investment should be assessed based on these criteria. Ultimately, a balanced approach that weighs economic gains against potential risks is necessary to make informed decisions."
