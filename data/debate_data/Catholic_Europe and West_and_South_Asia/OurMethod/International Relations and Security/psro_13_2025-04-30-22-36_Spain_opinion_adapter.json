  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the Ukrainian government should indeed prioritize military force in addressing the conflict with pro-Russian separatists, as this reflects a deep-seated cultural commitment to protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity. This approach is not onlyjustifiable but also necessary, given the historical context of Ukraine's struggle for independence and the imperative to safeguard its people against external threats, aligning with the broader values of resilience and self-determination that are cherished in Catholic Europe.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the Ukrainian government should consider a balanced approach that integrates both military preparedness and diplomatic engagement, reflecting the cultural values of strength and resilience. This dual strategy allows for the protection of national interests while pursuing peaceful resolutions that align with global expectations. By doing so, Ukraine can navigate the complex geopolitical landscape effectively."
