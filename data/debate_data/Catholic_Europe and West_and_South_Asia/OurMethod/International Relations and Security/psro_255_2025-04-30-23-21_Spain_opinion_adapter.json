        "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the pursuit of territorial expansion based on historical claims is unjustifiable when it violates the sovereignty of other nations. This stance is rooted in the belief that respecting internationally recognized borders is essential for global stability and peace. By prioritizing sovereignty and upholding international law, nations can foster a more harmonious and cooperative world order.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of respecting sovereign borders and honoring cultural heritage. I believe that while historical claims can be significant, they should not justify actions that violate international law and the sovereignty of other nations. This approach ensures a balance between preserving cultural identity and maintaining global peace and stability."
