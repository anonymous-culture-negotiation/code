  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my opinion, a country should prioritize its national interests over the interests of its allies, especially when cultural perspectives on loyalty and sovereignty are at stake. This approach not only preserves the country's cultural identity but also fosters a sense...of self-reliance and resilience, allowing it to navigate complex geopolitical landscapes with greater autonomy and confidence.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the idea that a country should prioritize its national interests, as this reflects a commitment to preserving its cultural identity and ensuring the well-being of its people. By doing so, a nation can navigate international relations with a clear sense of purpose and integrity, fostering trust and respect from both its citizens and global partners. This stance is essential in maintaining a balanced and resilient foreign policy."
