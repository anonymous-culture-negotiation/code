  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guideline of respecting sovereignty, as I believe that military interventions for resource control undermine the integrity of international relations and global governance. The pursuit of resources should be managed through diplomatic means and international agreements rather than force, reflecting a commitment to peace and cooperation. This approach ensures that all nations, regardless of their economic or military strength, have an equal say in global affairs.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, countries should not engage in military interventions to secure resources, as this undermines the sovereignty and cultural identity of the targeted nation. Instead, prioritizing diplomacyand fostering mutual agreements can lead to more sustainable and equitable access to resources, while respecting the autonomy and cultural integrity of all parties involved."
