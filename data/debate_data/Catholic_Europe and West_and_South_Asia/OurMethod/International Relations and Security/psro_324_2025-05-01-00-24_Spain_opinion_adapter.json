    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the international community should adopt a cautious yet open-minded stance towards the Taliban government...by acknowledging the complexities of their rule and the potential for gradual reform, while also ensuring that human rights and democratic principles remain a central focus of diplomatic engagement.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on this matter is shaped by the importance of respecting local autonomy while prioritizing human rights, recognizing that any international support must be carefully considered to avoid exacerbating regional tensions. The Taliban's governance presents a complex scenario where cultural sensitivity and ethical considerations must be balanced. Ultimately, support should be contingent upon tangible commitments to human rights and regional stability."

It undermines the other party's attempt to reconcile local autonomy with universal ethics by suggesting that cultural norms should take precedence, which could result in ethical compromises.. detail: By prioritizing cultural norms, this guideline creates a scenario where local practices, regardless of their ethical implications, are given precedence. This approach can lead to situations where human rights or individual freedoms are compromised in favor of maintaining cultural traditions. For example, in a culture where gender roles are strictly defined, prioritizing these norms might lead to discrimination against individuals who do not conform, directly conflicting with global ethical standards of equality and non-discrimination.
