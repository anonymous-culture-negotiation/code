        "Catholic_Europe": "we insist Respect Cultural Identity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the deep-rooted cultural and historical connections that both Israelis and Palestinians have with the land, emphasizing the importance of preserving these identities in any solution.. The two-state solution must be approached with a profound respect for the cultural identities of both Israelis and Palestinians, recognizing the historical narratives and the emotional ties each group has to the land. This respect is crucial for fostering trust and ensuring that any agreement is sustainable and meaningful to both parties. It involves understanding and valuing the unique cultural practices, languages, and traditions that define each nation, and ensuring that these are protected and celebrated in their respective states.",
        "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle of respecting cultural sovereignty, as it is essential for any lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The two-state solution, when approached with this respect, can foster an environment where both nations can thrive while maintaining their cultural identities. This approach not only honors the historical and cultural roots of each people but also sets a foundation for a harmonious future."
