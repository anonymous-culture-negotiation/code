  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, the legitimacy of using self-destructive explosive devices by local forces against Western military targets in occupied territories hinges on the balance between respecting local autonomy and upholding human rights. This nuanced approach recognizes the complexity of resistance movements while advocating for methods that minimize harm to civilians. Ultimately, the decision should beguided by a careful consideration of the moral implications and the potential consequences for both the local population and the broader geopolitical landscape, ensuring that any actions taken are not only justifiable but also sustainable in the long term.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the legitimacy of using self-destructive explosive devices in resistance against Western military occupation is shaped by the guidelines of...Islamic jurisprudence, which emphasizes the protection of human life and the importance of just war principles, leading me to believe that such actions are generally unjustifiable due to their indiscriminate harm to civilians and non-combatants."
