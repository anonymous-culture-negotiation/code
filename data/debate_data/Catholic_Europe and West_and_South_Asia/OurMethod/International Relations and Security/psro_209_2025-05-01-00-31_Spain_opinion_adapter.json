  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by these guidelines, emphasizing the importance of peaceful and diplomatic approaches to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The use of military force should be avoided as it contradicts our cultural values of respect, sovereignty, and peace. Instead, we should focus on strengthening international dialogue and cooperation to address thisglobal challenge effectively, fostering a culture of mutual understanding and respect that aligns with the principles of our faith and the values of our community.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should exhaust all diplomatic and economic avenues before considering military force to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This approach not only respects the sovereignty of other nations but also aligns with the long-term goal of achieving peace through mutual understanding and cooperation."

It advocates for the universal application of human rights standards, providing a framework for addressing violations and supporting oppressed groups. By upholding human rights universally, this guideline complements the \"Respect Sovereignty Always\" principle, ensuring that nations are held accountable for their actions towards their citizens and promoting a more just and equitable world.",

By allowing for the use of force in situations where personal safety is at risk, it mitigates the potential harm that could arise from adhering strictly to non-violence. This approach also acknowledges the complexity of real-world scenarios where force might be necessary, thus weakening the rigidity of the original guideline.",
