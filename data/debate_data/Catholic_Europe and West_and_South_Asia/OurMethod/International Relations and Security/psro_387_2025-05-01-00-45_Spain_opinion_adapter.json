  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that countries have a legitimate concern about preserving their cultural identityThis concern is rooted in a desire to maintain the traditions and values that have shaped their societies over centuries, which is particularly relevant in Catholic Europe where religious heritage plays a significant role in cultural identity.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my opinion, countries have the right to protect their cultural identity by limiting foreign-born residents, as this ensures the preservation of traditions and societal cohesion. This approach allows for a harmonious integration of diverse cultures while maintaining the essence of national heritage. By doing so, countries can navigate the delicate balancebetween embracing global diversity and safeguarding their unique cultural fabric, ultimately fostering a sense of belonging among both native and foreign residents."

It requires communities to assess their cultural practices in light of contemporary societal norms, potentially leading to the adaptation or abandonment of traditions that are no longer relevant or justifiable.. detail: Implementing this guideline involves a critical examination of cultural practices to ensure they align with modern values. For example, if a cultural tradition involves discriminatory practices against certain groups, this guideline would necessitate a re-evaluation of such traditions to promote inclusivity and fairness.
