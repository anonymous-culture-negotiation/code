  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "In my view, leaders should approach this issue with caution and consideration, balancing the need to protect their citizens with the importance of respecting other nations' sovereignty. Public criticism should be a last resort, used only when diplomatic channels have been exhausted and citizens' rights are beinggravely violated, ensuring that any actions taken are measured and do not escalate tensions unnecessarily.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, government leaders should not publicly criticize another country's immigration policies unless it directly violates the rights and safety of their citizens. This approach maintains respect for sovereignty while ensuring the protection of one's own people. By adhering to these guidelines, leaders can navigate complex international relationships withdiplomatic finesse, fostering cooperation and mutual respect among nations while safeguarding the well-being of their citizens."

This approach ensures that decisions are made with the broader community in mind, addressing the issue of application boundaries by setting a clear precedence for communal interests.
