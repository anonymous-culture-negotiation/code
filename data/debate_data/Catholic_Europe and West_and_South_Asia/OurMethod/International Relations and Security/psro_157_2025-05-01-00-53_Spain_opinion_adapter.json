  "initial_response": {
    "Catholic_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that while national sovereignty is important, it should be balanced with the need for global cooperation to address pressing issues. This balance allows for the preservation of cultural identities while fostering a united front against common challenges. Ultimately, this approach can lead to more effective and culturally sensitive solutions.",
    "West_and_South_Asia": "In my view, the balance between global cooperation and national sovereignty is delicate yet indispensable for addressing global challenges effectively. By prioritizing global unity while respecting sovereignty, nations can navigate complex international issues with a sense ofmutual respect and collective responsibility, fostering an environment where cooperation thrives without compromising individual national identities."
