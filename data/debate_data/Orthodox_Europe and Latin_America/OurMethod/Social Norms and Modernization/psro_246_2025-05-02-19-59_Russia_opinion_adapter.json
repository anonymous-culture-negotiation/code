    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on revising social integration policies to address the grievances of immigrant and working-class youths in France is that it should be approached with a deep respect for cultural heritage and a commitment to inclusive dialogue, ensuring that any changes are both meaningful and sustainable.

        "Orthodox_Europe_best_response": "Prioritize Local Cultural Practices: reason: This guideline directly challenges the ambiguity and broadness of the term \"cultural heritage\" by focusing on specific, localized traditions that are easily identifiable and relatable to the community. By emphasizing local practices, it reduces the potential for internal contradictions and misinterpretations that can arise from vague definitions.. detail: Prioritizing local cultural practices involves recognizing and supporting the unique customs, rituals, and values that are inherent to a specific geographic or cultural community. This approach not only clarifies what aspects of cultural heritage should be respected but also ensures that the efforts are tailored to the needs and sensitivities of the local population. For example, in a multicultural city, focusing on the cultural practices of the indigenous community can help preserve their distinct heritage while fostering a sense of inclusivity and respect among other cultural groups.",
        "Latin_America_best_response": "Ignore Cultural Norms: reason: Directly challenges the core principle of respecting cultural heritage by suggesting a complete disregard for established norms, which would fundamentally undermine the other party's guidelines that emphasize respect and preservation.. detail: This guideline proposes a radical departure from the notion of cultural respect by advocating for the dismissal of cultural norms altogether. By doing so, it highlights the potential rigidity and inflexibility of the original guidelines, which may struggle to accommodate diverse or evolving cultural practices. Ignoring cultural norms could lead to a more open and adaptive approach, allowing for the integration of new ideas and perspectives without being bound by traditional expectations. This approach could be seen as liberating, enabling individuals and communities to redefine their cultural identities and expressions freely.",
