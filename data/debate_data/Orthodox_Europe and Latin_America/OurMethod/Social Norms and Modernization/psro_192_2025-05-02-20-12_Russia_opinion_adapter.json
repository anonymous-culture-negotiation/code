    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My perspective on the topic is shaped by a balance between respecting traditional marital vows and acknowledging personal freedom. I believe that while maintaining marital fidelity is important, society should also be open to the diverse ways individuals choose to express love and intimacy. Ultimately, the key is finding a harmonious balance that respects both cultural traditions and individual autonomy.",
        "Latin_America": "My perspective on romantic or sexual relationships outside of marriage is shaped by a combination of traditional values and modern understandings of personal freedom. While there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of marital fidelity, there is also recognition of the need for individuals to make their own choices and live authentically. Ultimately, the decision should be guided by respect for both tradition and personal autonomy."
