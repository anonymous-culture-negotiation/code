By doing so, it creates a clear hierarchy where local customs take precedence, potentially limiting the influence and effectiveness of cultural exchange programs.. detail: This guideline suggests that in any situation where there is a conflict between local traditions and cultural exchange initiatives, the local norms should be given priority. This approach can lead to a more cohesive cultural environment within the community but may restrict the diversity and richness that cultural exchanges could bring. It addresses the weaknesses by clarifying the potential internal contradictions and application boundaries, making it clear that local traditions are not to be compromised.",

It emphasizes the importance of objectivity in assessing traditions, which can help mitigate the influence of personal biases and cultural pressures that might hinder critical evaluation.. detail: The guideline \"Evaluate Traditions Objectively Always\" proposes that all cultural traditions should be subject to objective evaluation, ensuring that the assessment is based on universally accepted principles rather than subjective interpretations. This approach can help communities navigate the complex landscape of cultural heritage and progressive change by providing a clear framework for decision-making. For instance, evaluating a tradition objectively might involve considering its impact on social justice, its alignment with human rights, and its potential for fostering inclusivity and respect for diversity. By doing so, communities can make informed decisions about which traditions to preserve and which to adapt or discard, thereby strengthening their cultural resilience and relevance in a changing world.",
