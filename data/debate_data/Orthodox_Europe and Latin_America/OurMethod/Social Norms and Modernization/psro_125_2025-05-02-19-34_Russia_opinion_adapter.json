    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that governments should indeed promote multicultural diversity as it enriches the cultural tapestry of a nation and can lead to greater social cohesion. By respecting cultural heritage and fostering inclusive dialogue, societies can harness the benefits of diversity while addressing the challenges it presents. This approach not only celebrates differences but also builds a foundation for a more harmonious and resilient community.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, promoting multicultural diversity is a cornerstone of building a strong, inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. By embracing our differences, we enrich our collective cultural tapestry, creating a vibrant and dynamic national identity. This inclusive approach not only strengthens national unity but also fosters a sense of belonging among all citizens."

For instance, when planning a cultural festival, the advisory board could provide insights on appropriate music, attire, and rituals, thereby avoiding cultural missteps and promoting genuine cultural exchange.
