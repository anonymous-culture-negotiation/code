    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the practice of marrying individuals under 18 should be approached with a deep understanding of the cultural context while also considering the potential risks to children's well-being. It is crucial to engage in open dialogue that respects tradition but also prioritizes the protection and empowerment of young individuals. This balanced perspective allows for a nuanced discussion that values both cultural identity and global human rights standards.",
