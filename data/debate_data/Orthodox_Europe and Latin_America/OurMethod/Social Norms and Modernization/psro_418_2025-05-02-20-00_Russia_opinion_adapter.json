  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my opinion, implementing stricter immigration policies when newcomers' cultural practices significantly differ from the host nation's traditions is essential for maintaining social cohesion and cultural continuity. This approach not only protects the cultural fabric of the host country but also fosters a sense of belonging among its citizens. By prioritizing cultural integrity, a nation can ensure that its values and customs remain vibrant and relevant in the face of globalization and cultural exchange.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is that countries should indeed implement stricter immigration policies when newcomersare not willing to integrate into the local culture and contribute positively to the society, as this can lead to social and economic disruptions that affect the native population."

This approach can lead to a more cohesive cultural narrative but may result in restrictions on personal expression and choice. For example, in a society where traditional practices are deeply ingrained, prioritizing cultural continuity might mean that individuals are expected to adhere to these practices, regardless of their personal beliefs or desires.
