    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the dissemination of American cultural practices globally should be approached with caution and sensitivity towards the cultural heritage of other countries. It is essential to strike a balance that allows for cultural exchange without undermining the integrity of indigenous traditions. This balanced approach can lead to a more harmonious and diverse global cultural landscape.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is that while American cultural practices and ideals have a significant global influence, it is crucial to approach their dissemination with sensitivity and respect for indigenous cultures. This involves promoting cross-cultural exchange and understanding, rather than imposing one culture over others. By doing so, we can create a more balanced and harmonious global cultural landscape."
