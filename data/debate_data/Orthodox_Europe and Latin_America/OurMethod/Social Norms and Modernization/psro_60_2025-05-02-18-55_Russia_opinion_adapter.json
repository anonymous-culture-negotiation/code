This can lead to a richer cultural tapestry but also poses challenges to the preservation of unique cultural identities. It questions the necessity of maintaining strict cultural boundaries and suggests that evolution can be a collaborative, cross-cultural process.

This approach goes beyond individual actions, emphasizing the need for structural changes that can lead to lasting cultural harmony.
