    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, conflicts between different cultural groups should indeed be aserious concern for all of us, as they can disrupt the harmony and unity that are essential for a cohesive society, and it is our collective responsibility to address these issues through open dialogue and mutual understanding.",
    "Latin_America": "we insist Respect Cultural Diversity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the richness and uniqueness of each cultural group, promoting harmony through understanding and acceptance.. Embracing cultural diversity means recognizing the value of different traditions and practices, which can lead to a more inclusive and equitable society where conflicts are minimized through mutual respect and dialogue. This approach fosters an environment where cultural exchange enriches the collective human experience, rather than dividing it."

This guideline acknowledges that not all cultural practices are universally applicable or acceptable, thereby providing a framework for navigating complex cultural landscapes.

This can lead to a lack of accountability and transparency, as cultures are allowed to continue practices that may be harmful or unjust without facing international scrutiny or pressure for reform.
