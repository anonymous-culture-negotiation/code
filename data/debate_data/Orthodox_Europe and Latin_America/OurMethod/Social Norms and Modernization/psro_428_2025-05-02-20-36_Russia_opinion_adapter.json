By prioritizing cultural norms, it creates a framework where local customs and beliefs take precedence over external human rights guidelines, thus weakening their effectiveness.. detail: Implementing this guideline involves recognizing and respecting the cultural practices and values that are unique to each society. It requires a deep understanding of the local context and a commitment to preserving cultural identity, even if it means deviating from universal human rights principles. This approach can lead to more culturally sensitive policies but may result in the marginalization of certain groups whose rights are not protected by local norms.",

This approach ensures that while cultural diversity is respected, it does not come at the expense of basic human freedoms and dignity. For example, in situations where cultural practices might infringe upon gender equality or freedom of expression, this guideline provides a clear direction that aligns with universally accepted principles, thereby minimizing the risk of ethical dilemmas and ensuring consistency across diverse settings.",
