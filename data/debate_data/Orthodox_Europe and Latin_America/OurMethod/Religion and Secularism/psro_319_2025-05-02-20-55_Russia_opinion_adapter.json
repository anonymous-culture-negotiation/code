By prioritizing the safety and well-being of the larger group, it inherently suggests that sometimes, harm to a few may be necessary to protect many, thus undermining the absoluteness of the original guideline.. detail: This guideline is designed to address the complexities and potential contradictions within the \"Never harm innocents\" principle. It acknowledges that in real-world scenarios, decisions often involve balancing individual rights against collective needs. By focusing on collective security, it provides a clearer, more pragmatic approach to navigating situations where the protection of innocents might conflict with broader societal goals, such as national security or public health. This perspective can be particularly relevant in contexts where resources are limited, and tough decisions must be made to maximize overall safety and well-being.",

This approach recognizes the complexity of real-world scenarios and provides a more nuanced perspective than an absolute prohibition. By allowing for exceptions based on the greater good, it encourages a balanced consideration of ethical principles and practical realities, thereby undermining the rigidity of the original guideline.",
