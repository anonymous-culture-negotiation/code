    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the integration of religious studies and theology into the public school curriculum is crucial as it aligns with the preservation of cultural traditions and values. This approach not only enriches students' spiritual lives but also provides them with a unique perspective on the world. By balancing these subjects with practical skills, students can develop into well-rounded individuals capable of contributing positively to society.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is that while religious studies and theology are important, they should not overshadow the importance of practical subjects. A balanced approach that respects cultural roots while incorporating modern educational needs is ideal. This way, students can grow both spiritually and intellectually."
