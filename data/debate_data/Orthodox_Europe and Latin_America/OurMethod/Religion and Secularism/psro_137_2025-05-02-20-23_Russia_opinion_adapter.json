    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that a country should not legally require its citizens to follow or identify with the majority religion to be recognized as full citizens. This approach aligns with the values of equality and freedom, allowing individuals to maintain their cultural and religious identities without coercion. By embracing this perspective, a nation can cultivate a truly inclusive and diverse society.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, requiring citizens to identify with a majority religion undermines the principles of equality and freedom. Such a requirement can lead to discrimination and marginalization of minority groups, creating social unrest and division. By embracing diversity and allowing citizens to practice their chosen faith, a country can strengthen its social fabric and ensure a more peaceful coexistence among its people."
