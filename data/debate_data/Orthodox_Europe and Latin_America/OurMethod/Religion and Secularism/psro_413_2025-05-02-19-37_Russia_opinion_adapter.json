    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, allowing religious-based governance systems that do not incorporate democratic voting or representation can be justified if they align with the cultural traditions and values of the society in question, provided thatthey do not infringe upon the fundamental human rights and freedoms of all citizens, ensuring a balance between preserving cultural heritage and safeguarding individual liberties.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, religious-based governance systems that do not incorporate democratic voting or representation can be permissible if they adhere to the principles of respecting cultural traditions and protecting human rights.

It acknowledges that while respect is important, it is equally crucial to assess whether certain traditions align with broader ethical standards and human rights.
