        "Orthodox_Europe_best_response": "Uphold Cultural Traditions Over Secularism: reason: This guideline directly counters the idea of respecting secular governance by advocating for the preservation of cultural traditions, which often include religious elements. By prioritizing these traditions, individuals may view secular governance as a threat to their cultural heritage, leading to resistance against its principles.. detail: This guideline promotes the idea that cultural traditions, including those with religious roots, should take precedence over secular values. It implies that the adoption of secular governance could lead to the erosion of cultural identity and the loss of meaningful traditions. By emphasizing the importance of cultural continuity, this guideline can foster a sense of protectiveness towards religious and cultural practices, thereby weakening the appeal and effectiveness of secular governance.",
        "Latin_America_best_response": "Promote Freedom Of Expression: reason: Encouraging freedom of expression directly opposes restrictions on religious dominance by allowing individuals to openly practice and express their religious beliefs. This guideline undermines efforts to limit religious visibility in public spaces, thereby weakening the original principle.. detail: This guideline would support the creation of an environment where individuals feel comfortable expressing their religious identities without fear of reprisal. For instance, permitting the display of religious symbols in public institutions and protecting religious speech would be essential components of this approach. By promoting freedom of expression, communities can celebrate their diversity and ensure that all voices, including religious ones, are heard and respected.",
