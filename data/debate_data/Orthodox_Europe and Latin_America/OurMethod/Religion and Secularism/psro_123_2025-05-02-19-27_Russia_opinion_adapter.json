    "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Cultural Identity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it allows Western societies to maintain their unique cultural heritage while considering the needs of diverse communities.. By prioritizing respect for cultural identity, Western societies can ensure that any accommodations made for Islamic practices do not compromise their core values and traditions. This approach fosters a harmonious coexistence where both the host culture and the immigrant community can thrive without losing their distinctiveness.",
    "Latin_America": "In my opinion, Western secular societies should strive to create an environment where traditional Islamic practices can be observed respectfully, but without compromising the fundamental values of secularism and cultural identity. This can be achieved through open dialogue and understanding, ensuring that accommodations are made thoughtfully anddo not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others, thereby fostering a harmonious coexistence that values diversity while upholding societal norms."
