        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Personal Beliefs, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the diversity of beliefs within a society and prevents the imposition of one belief system over another.. Respecting personal beliefs is crucial in maintaining social harmony and individual freedom, allowing citizens to choose their own path without coercion from governmental or religious authorities. This approach fosters a culture of tolerance and understanding, where different perspectives can coexist peacefully.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, the government should not legally mandate trust in religious institutions, as this would infringe upon the fundamental right to freedom of religion and belief. Instead, fostering an environment where individuals can explore and express their beliefs freely is crucial. This approach not only respects personal autonomy but also strengthens the social fabric by encouraging dialogue and mutual respect."
