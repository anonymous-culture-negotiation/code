        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that Muslim communities should be allowed to maintain their distinct religious and cultural identities while living in non-Muslim majority countries. This approach not only respects their cultural heritage but also enriches the cultural diversity of the host country. By embracing such diversity, societies can foster a more inclusive and harmonious environment.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that Muslim communities should have the right to maintain their cultural and religious identities. This perspective is rooted in the importance of diversity and the need for inclusive societies that respect and celebrate different traditions. By allowing Muslim communities to preserve their identities, we foster a more harmonious and equitable world."
