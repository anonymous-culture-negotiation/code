    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the role of religious leaders in shaping government policies shouldIn my view, the role of religious leaders in shaping government policies should be approached with caution, as their influence can sometimes blur the lines between church and state, potentially leading to a lack of separation that is crucial for maintaining democratic principles and ensuring equal rights for all citizens.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic aligns with the principles of maintaining a clear distinction between religious and governmental spheres, ensuring that policies are crafted with the broader public interest in mind rather than specific religious doctrines. This approach supports a more equitable and just society where all individuals can thrive without fear of religious discrimination. By respecting cultural diversity and fostering open dialogue, nations can create inclusive environments that celebrate differences while adhering to democratic values."
