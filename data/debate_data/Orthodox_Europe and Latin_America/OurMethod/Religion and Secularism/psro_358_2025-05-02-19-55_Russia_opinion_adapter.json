By doing so, it undermines the universal applicability of human rights, suggesting that cultural heritage is more important than individual rights. This direct confrontation with the other party's stance effectively weakens their argument by providing an alternative perspective that prioritizes tradition.. detail: The guideline \"Respect Tradition Over Rights\" is straightforward in its challenge to the other party's guidelines. It implies that cultural traditions, regardless of their impact on human rights, should be respected and maintained. This perspective can be used to justify practices that are controversial or harmful from a human rights standpoint, such as female genital mutilation or honor killings, under the guise of preserving cultural heritage.
