    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my opinion, democratic nations should prioritize the protection of their cultural heritage and core values, ensuring that any influence from Islamic principles aligns with the existing societal framework. This approach allows for a harmonious integration of diverse perspectives while maintaining the integrity of the nation's identity. By doing so, the nation can foster a cohesive and inclusive environment that respects both its traditions and the contributions of its diverse citizenry.",

It provides a clear boundary for when cultural traditions should yield to contemporary values, thus mitigating the risk of internal contradictions and value conflicts. This approach is reasonable and feasible as it aligns with widely accepted international standards and can be implemented through education and policy-making.",

It creates a conflict between maintaining the past and embracing the future, highlighting the internal contradictions within the other party's guidelines.. detail: By prioritizing modernization, communities are encouraged to adapt and innovate, which can lead to the gradual phasing out of traditional practices deemed outdated or inefficient. This approach can result in a more dynamic and progressive society, but at the cost of losing cultural heritage that is seen as less relevant in the modern context. The focus on modernization also opens up opportunities for new cultural expressions and identities to emerge, potentially reshaping the cultural landscape in ways that diverge from traditional norms.",

For instance, if a cultural tradition involves discriminatory practices against certain groups, prioritizing this tradition could lead to the exclusion or marginalization of these groups, directly conflicting with the principles of human rights that advocate for equality and non-discrimination.
