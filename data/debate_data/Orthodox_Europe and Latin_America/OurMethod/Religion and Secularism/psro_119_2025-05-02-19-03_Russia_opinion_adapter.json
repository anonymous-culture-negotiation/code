By upholding human rights as a foundational principle, individuals and communities can navigate situations where religious beliefs may conflict with broader societal values. For instance, if a religious teaching is perceived to infringe upon equality or justice, prioritizing human rights provides a clear framework for addressing and resolving such conflicts. This approach not only strengthens the commitment to inclusivity but also ensures that respect for faith diversity is practiced in a way that is consistent with the principles of fairness and justice.",

It ensures that universal principles of equality and non-discrimination are upheld, even if they conflict with specific religious teachings.. detail: Implementing this guideline means that any religious practice or belief that contradicts fundamental human rights, such as equality for all genders or protection against discrimination, would not be accommodated. This approach provides a clear framework for navigating the complexities of religious diversity while maintaining a commitment to inclusivity and justice. It addresses the weakness of ambiguous application boundaries by setting a definitive standard that prioritizes human rights, thereby limiting the potential for religious practices to override secular laws and societal norms.",

This approach can lead to situations where human rights are compromised in favor of religious beliefs, especially in areas such as gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, or freedom of expression. For instance, in communities where religious traditions are deeply rooted, this guideline might justify limiting women's rights or discriminating against LGBTQ+ individuals if such actions are deemed consistent with religious teachings.
