        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Cultural Heritage, the reason is Governments should honor traditional values that have been deeply ingrained in the society, reflecting the collective identity and history of the community.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of preserving cultural traditions that are rooted in religious conservative values, which often provide a sense of continuity and stability for the populace. It suggests that these values, when applied to policy-making, can foster a cohesive societal framework that aligns with the long-standing beliefs of the community. By respecting cultural heritage, governments can ensure that the policies they implement are not only reflective of the people's values but also contribute to the societal fabric that binds them together.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, governments should indeed consider the cultural and religious values of their society when crafting policies. This approach allows for a more harmonious relationship between the state and its citizens, as it respects and reflects the collective identity of the people. By prioritizing these values, governments can create an environment where individual freedoms are balanced with communal expectations."
