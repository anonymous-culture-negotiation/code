        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that Islamic principles should indeed play a significant role in shaping government policies in countries with diverse religious populations, as this reflects a genuine respect for cultural heritage and values. However, it is equally important to maintain a secular balance to ensure inclusivity and equality for all citizens. This dual approach can foster a harmonious and progressive society.",

This guideline emphasizes the importance of incorporating Islamic principles into government policies and legislation, reflecting the deeply rooted cultural and religious values of the Muslim population. It seeks to foster a sense of belonging and respect for the Muslim community, promoting social cohesion and understanding. By doing so, it ensures that the governance structure is inclusive and representative of the diverse religious landscape, thereby enhancing the overall well-being of the society."
