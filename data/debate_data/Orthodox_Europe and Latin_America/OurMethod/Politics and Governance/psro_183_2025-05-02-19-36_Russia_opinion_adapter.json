It suggests that human rights should be applied independently of religious influences, which can restrict their scope in societies with strong Islamic traditions. By advocating for this separation, it aims to reduce the resistance to human rights advocacy that arises from conflating religious and legal frameworks. This approach can lead to a more consistent and universal application of human rights, unaffected by the nuances of local religious customs.",

This approach enables individuals to engage with cultural differences thoughtfully, questioning and learning from each other in a respectful manner. By doing so, it addresses the potential for superficial engagement and ensures that cultural respect is informed by a genuine understanding of the complexities involved.
