  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the authority to censor media publications containing economically sensitive information should be approached with caution, balancing the need to protect economic stability with the importance of transparency and accountability. This nuanced perspective respects both the cultural value ofopen communication and the pragmatic necessity of safeguarding sensitive economic data, reflecting a deep-rooted belief in the importance of maintaining societal trust through responsible governance.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guideline of protecting national interests, as it is crucial for maintaining economic stability and preventing external manipulation. By regulating sensitive information, governments can ensure that the economy is not adversely affected by speculative or misleading data. This approach reflects a deep respect for the collective good and the need to safeguard national security in a rapidly changing global landscape."
