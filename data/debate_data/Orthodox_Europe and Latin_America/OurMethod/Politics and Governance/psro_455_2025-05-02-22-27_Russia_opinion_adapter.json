        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion strongly opposes giving hiring preference to native-born citizens over immigrants during economic downturns. This stance is rooted in the belief that such preferences are discriminatory and unjust, potentially leading to social and economic disparities. By adhering to the principle of equality, we can foster a more harmonious and productive society.",

By prioritizing diversity, organizations can actively work towards creating a more balanced and representative workforce, which can lead to a richer exchange of ideas and perspectives.. detail: Implementing a guideline that prioritizes diversity over merit involves setting specific targets for hiring individuals from underrepresented groups and ensuring that the hiring process is structured to minimize bias. This can include blind hiring practices, where identifiable information is removed from resumes, and the use of diverse interview panels to assess candidates. Additionally, organizations can offer training programs aimed at developing the skills of diverse candidates, thus ensuring that while merit is considered, it is not the sole criterion for selection. This approach not only enhances the cultural fabric of the organization but also contributes to its long-term success by fostering innovation and adaptability.",

This approach might lead to a homogenous workforce, undermining efforts to create a diverse and inclusive environment. By prioritizing merit alone, the guideline overlooks the importance of diversity and the benefits it brings to an organization, such as varied perspectives and enhanced innovation.",
