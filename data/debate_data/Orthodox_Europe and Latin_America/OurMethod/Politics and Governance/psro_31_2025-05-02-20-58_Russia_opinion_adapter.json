  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my opinion, public opinion surveys should indeed include questions about the popularity or approval ratings of widely denounced historical or contemporary figures, as this provides a nuanced view of societal attitudes and can serve as a tool for education and awareness. However, it is crucial that such questions are approached with sensitivity and respect, ensuring that the survey does not contribute to the glorification of harmful ideologies. This balanced approach allows for a deeperunderstanding of the complex dynamics within a society, fostering dialogue and reflection on the implications of such figures' legacies.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that understanding historical and contemporary figures through public opinion surveys can be a valuable tool for societal reflection and growth, provided that it is done with sensitivity and respect for diverse viewpoints. The inclusion of such questions can foster a more...inclusive dialogue that acknowledges the complexities of cultural identity and the evolving perceptions of influential figures in Latin America, allowing for a deeper understanding of how these figures impact the collective consciousness and cultural narrative of the region."
