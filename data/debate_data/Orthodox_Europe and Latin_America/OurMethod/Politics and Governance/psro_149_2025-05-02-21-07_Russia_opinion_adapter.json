        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that immigration policies should be grounded in fairness and equality, rather than influenced by cultural biases or stereotypes. These guidelines highlight the importance of avoiding racial profiling and ensuring a fair legal process, reflecting a commitment to justice and human rights. By adhering to these principles, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society.",
