  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the media should not publish classified information related to national security without government approval, as this could lead to serious repercussions for the country's safety and stability. The guidelines of protecting national security and...the potential harm that can arise from unauthorized disclosures should be paramount in the decision-making process of media outlets, ensuring that the public's right to information is balanced with the need to safeguard sensitive matters that could compromise the nation's well-being.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, while the media has a responsibility to inform the public, it must do so without jeopardizing national security. The government should work closely with media organizations to find a balance that respects both the need for transparency and the protection of sensitive information. This approach ensures that the public remains informed while safeguarding the nation's interests."

This approach balances the need to protect secrets with the necessity to address ethical concerns, thereby weakening the rigid application of the original guideline and promoting a more adaptable and responsible information management strategy.",
        "Latin_America_best_response": "Prioritize Transparency Always: reason: Counters secrecy in security measures. detail: This guideline emphasizes the importance of transparency in all actions related to national security. By prioritizing openness, it challenges the tendency to justify secrecy under the pretext of security, which can lead to abuse of power and infringement on civil liberties. Transparency ensures that the public is informed about the measures being taken and can hold authorities accountable for any overreach. This not only builds trust but also acts as a deterrent against unjustified security actions.",

It weakens the original guidelines by introducing a clear and objective standard for disclosure, which can help in resolving ethical dilemmas and ensuring that information is handled consistently across different contexts.

It removes the complexity of deciding what constitutes a \"safe\" disclosure and instead opts for a straightforward approach that prioritizes transparency over secrecy.
