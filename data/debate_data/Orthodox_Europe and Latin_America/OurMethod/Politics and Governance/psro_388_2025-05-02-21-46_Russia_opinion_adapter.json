  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, acts of political violence should not be justified, as they can lead to a cycle of retaliation and undermine the moral foundations of the resistance. Nonviolent resistance, on the other hand, offers a powerful and ethical alternative that can bring about meaningful change while preserving the dignity and integrity of the movement. This approach aligns with the values of peace and justice, ensuring a more sustainable and inclusive path forward.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, acts of political violence should not be justified as they contradict the principles of nonviolence and respect for human life, which are central to many cultural traditions. Instead, movements should focus on peaceful protests and dialogue to bring about change. This approach not only aligns with cultural values but also fosters a more sustainable and inclusive pathThis perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that meaningful change can only be achieved through methods that uphold dignity and promote unity, rather than causing division and harm."

This principle is specific and clear, as it focuses on the context of liberation movements and resistance against oppression. It is reasonable and feasible because it reflects historical realities and ongoing struggles for justice and equality. By recognizing the role of violence in these contexts, it directly addresses the limitations of the \"Violence Never Justified\" guideline, particularly in terms of its potential application boundaries and conflicts with other values such as justice and equality.",
