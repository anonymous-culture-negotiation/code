        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Human Rights, the reason is This guideline is essential because it emphasizes the importance of protecting individual freedoms and dignity, which are fundamental to human existence and should not be compromised by governmental control.. The principle of respecting human rights is deeply rooted in the belief that all individuals deserve to live without fear of oppression or persecution, allowing them to contribute fully to society. This respect fosters an environment where people can express themselves freely and participate in the democratic process, which is crucial for the development of a healthy and progressive society. It also reflects a commitment to upholding universal values that transcend national boundaries, ensuring that human rights are not merely a privilege but a right for all.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, the ability of non-governmental human rights organizations to operate freely is crucial for promoting justice and equality, even in countries with authoritarian governments. These organizations play a vital role in bringing attention to human rights abuses and advocating for change. Ultimately, their presence can foster a more equitable society, even if it requires navigating complex political landscapes."

By prioritizing cultural norms, it directly addresses the internal contradictions and value conflicts inherent in the other party's guidelines, which struggle to reconcile universal human rights with diverse cultural practices.. detail: This guideline suggests that cultural norms and values should take precedence over universally defined human rights. It acknowledges that different cultures have unique perspectives and practices that may not align with global human rights standards. By prioritizing cultural norms, it allows for a more tailored approach to human rights, respecting the diversity of cultural contexts. This approach can lead to a more harmonious integration of human rights within the cultural fabric of a society, reducing potential conflicts and enhancing the acceptance and effectiveness of human rights protection.",

By introducing such exceptions, the guideline creates room for maneuverability that can undermine the consistent application of human rights principles. For example, a government might justify certain actions as necessary for national security, even if they violate human rights, thus creating a loophole that challenges the universality and strictness of the other party's guideline.
