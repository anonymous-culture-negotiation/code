    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by a profound respect for Japan's peace tradition, which I believe should continue to guide its national policies. This commitment to peace is not only a reflection of past experiences but also a forward-looking approach that prioritizes stability and cooperation on the global stage.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly aligns with the idea that Japan should not amend Article 9, as doing so would undermine its commitment to peace and potentially destabilize the region. This perspective is deeply rooted in the cultural value of harmony and the historical lessons learned from the devastating consequences of war. By maintaining its current stance, Japan can continue to serve as a model for peaceful coexistence and diplomatic resolution of conflicts."
