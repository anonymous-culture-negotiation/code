By promoting mutual understanding and respect, this guideline facilitates a more inclusive and harmonious societal environment where cultural sovereignty is respected without compromising social cohesion or ethical standards. It also allows for the evolution of cultural practices in a way that is collaborative and respectful of all parties involved.",

It suggests that in any situation where human rights are violated, intervention or action should be taken, regardless of the nation's sovereignty claims. This approach provides ethical clarity and a consistent framework for decision-making, potentially leading to more cohesive international policies that uphold universal values.",
