    "Orthodox_Europe": "My perspective on granting pathways to legal status for individuals residing in the United States without legal authorization is deeply rooted in the belief that economic contributions and humanitarian needs should be balanced with respect for human rights. This approach not only reflects a commitment to social justice but also recognizes the practical benefits of integrating skilled and dedicated workers into the legal workforce. By embracing this stance, we can cultivate a more inclusive and prosperous society.",

By prioritizing cultural norms, it creates a framework where local customs and beliefs take precedence, potentially undermining the enforcement of universal human rights.. detail: This guideline is designed to address the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the original \"Respect Human Rights\" directive. By placing cultural norms at the forefront, it acknowledges the diversity of cultural values and the potential for these values to supersede universal human rights. For instance, in a society where traditional practices are deeply ingrained, this guideline would support the continuation of these practices even if they conflict with certain human rights, thus providing a clear and reasonable approach to navigating cultural complexities.",
        "Latin_America_best_response": "Prioritize Local Norms Over Universal Rights: reason: This guideline challenges the broad and vague nature of the original principle by emphasizing the importance of local customs and norms, which can vary significantly and may not always align with universal human rights standards. By prioritizing local norms, it creates a direct conflict with the idea of respecting universal human rights, thus weakening the effectiveness of the original guideline.. detail: This guideline suggests that in any given situation, local cultural norms and practices should take precedence over universal human rights principles. For example, in a community where traditional practices are deeply ingrained, this guideline would support adhering to those practices even if they conflict with recognized human rights. This approach can lead to a more localized and culturally sensitive application of rights, but it risks undermining the universal applicability and protection of human rights as defined by international standards.",
        "Orthodox_Europe_response": "We propose the guideline \"Prioritize Cultural Norms Over Rights,\" which emphasizes the importance of respecting and upholding cultural traditions and norms, even when they may conflict with universal human rights standards. This approach acknowledges the diversity of cultural values and allows for a more nuanced understanding of human rights within specific cultural contexts.",
        "Latin_America_response": "In this round, our new guideline, \"Prioritize Local Norms Over Universal Rights,\" reflects a nuanced approach that respects the diversity of cultural practices and norms, acknowledging that universal human rights may not always align with local traditions. This perspective allows for a more culturally sensitive application of rights, although it may challenge the universal applicability of human rights principles.",
