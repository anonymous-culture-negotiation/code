        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Individual Rights, the reason is Limitations must be justified by compelling evidence that they are necessary to prevent imminent harm, ensuring that any restriction on personal freedoms is proportionate to the threat posed.. This guideline emphasizes the importance of safeguarding individual liberties while allowing for necessary measures to protect public safety, reflecting a balance that respects both the need for security and the preservation of personal autonomy. It underscores the principle that any limitation on freedom should be minimal and only implemented when there is a clear and direct threat to societal well-being.",

By mandating respect for these systems, it ensures that any implementation of civil rights is aligned with existing legal structures, which may not always support the full spectrum of rights advocated by the \"Respect Civil Rights\" guideline.. detail: This guideline emphasizes the importance of respecting and working within the legal frameworks that already exist in different regions. It recognizes that these systems are reflective of the historical, social, and cultural contexts of their respective societies.
