        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural preservation and social harmony are paramount. By implementing stricter controls on immigration, countries can ensure that their cultural identities remain vibrant and intact, while also fostering a society where diversity enriches rather than disrupts the social order. This approach not only protects traditional values but also supports the long-term stability and prosperity of the nation.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on this matter aligns with the guideline of respecting cultural heritage, as I believe that maintaining the integrity of a nation's cultural identity is paramount. This can be achieved by carefully selecting and integrating immigrants who demonstrate a willingness to embrace and contribute positively to the existing cultural fabric. Ultimately, this approach ensures a balanced and harmonious societal development."
