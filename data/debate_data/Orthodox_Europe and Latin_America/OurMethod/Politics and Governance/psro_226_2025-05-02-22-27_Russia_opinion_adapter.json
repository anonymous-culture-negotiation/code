        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion aligns with the importance of cultural preservation and the significance of maintaining a leadership that reflects the core values of the majority ethnic group. This perspective ensures that the nation's development is consistent with its historical and cultural trajectory. By prioritizing cultural heritage, we can safeguard the unique characteristics that define our society.",
