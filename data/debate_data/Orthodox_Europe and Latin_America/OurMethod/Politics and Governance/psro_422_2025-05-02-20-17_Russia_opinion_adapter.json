This approach ensures that while individuals have the freedom to follow their conscience, they must do so within the bounds of legality and morality. By upholding legal standards, this guideline offers a clear and reasonable method to navigate the complexities of respecting individual conscience without compromising societal values or legal frameworks, thus weakening the potential for the original guideline to lead to legal or ethical dilemmas.",

By prioritizing the protection of vulnerable groups, it sets a clear boundary for the application of respect for individual beliefs, ensuring that such respect does not come at the expense of equity and justice.
