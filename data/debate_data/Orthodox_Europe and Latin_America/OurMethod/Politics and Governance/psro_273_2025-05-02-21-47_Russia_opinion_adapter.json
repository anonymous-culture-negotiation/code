Embracing national sovereignty in regulating the movement of EU citizens reflects a deep respect for the diverse cultural fabric that weaves the EU together. It recognizes that while unity is important, preserving the distinct identity of each nation is crucial for fostering a sense of belonging and maintaining social cohesion. This approach ensures that policies are not one-size-fits-all but are instead crafted with the nuances of each country's values and customs in mind."
