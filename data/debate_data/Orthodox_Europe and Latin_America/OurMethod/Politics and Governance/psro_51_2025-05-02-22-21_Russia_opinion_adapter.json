  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In light of these considerations, it is evident that the international community should not extend formal recognition to the Taliban, as doing so would be tantamount to condoning their egregious human rights record. This decision reflects a commitment to safeguarding the dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of gender, religion, or ethnicity. By maintaining this position, the world can continue to advocate for a more just and equitable society in Afghanistan.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the matter is deeply rooted in the beliefthat the cultural richness and diversity of Latin America are often overshadowed by misconceptions and stereotypes, which can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the region's unique contributions to the global community."
