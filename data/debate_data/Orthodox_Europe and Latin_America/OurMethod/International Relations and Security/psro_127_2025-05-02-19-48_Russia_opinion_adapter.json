    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "Ukraine's decision to join the EAEU should be guided by a careful consideration of its sovereignty and national interest, weighing the potential economic benefits against the geopolitical risks. This approach ensures that any decision made is deeply rooted in Ukraine's cultural values and historical context. Ultimately, prioritizing these aspects will allow Ukraine to navigate the complex landscape of international relations with integrity and foresight.",
        "Latin_America": "In my opinion, Ukraine should exercise extreme caution in considering membership in the Eurasian Economic Union, as it could lead to a loss of sovereignty and compromise its democratic values. The country must prioritize its own economic and political interests while navigating the complex geopolitical landscape. Ultimately, any decision should be made with the welfare and future of its citizens as the primary consideration."
