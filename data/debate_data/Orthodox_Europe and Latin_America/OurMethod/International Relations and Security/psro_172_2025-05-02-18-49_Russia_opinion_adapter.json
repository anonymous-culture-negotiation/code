  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the integration of immigrants from former Soviet Bloc countries into Western societies should be approached with caution and careful consideration of the cultural implications. By prioritizing respect for cultural heritage and adopting a selective immigration strategy, Western nations can foster a more harmonious and culturally resilient society. This balanced approach allows for the enrichment of Westerncultures through the inclusion of diverse perspectives while minimizing the risk of cultural disruption and social fragmentation, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and thriving community.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural integrity is paramount, and thus, immigration should be managed in a way that respects and maintains the core values of Western nations. This perspective advocates for thoughtful and selective policies that ensure compatibility and mutual respect between the host culture and the immigrant communities. By doing so, we can foster a cohesive society where diversity enriches the cultural tapestry without eroding its foundational elements."
