  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Prioritize National Interest, the reason is This guideline is necessary because it ensures that the United States maintains sovereignty in its decision-making processes, especially in sensitive geopolitical matters.. Prioritizing national interest allows the U.S. to evaluate its counterterrorism strategies based on its own security needs and global influence, rather than solely on the interests of its allies. This approach fosters a balanced and independent foreign policy that can adapt to evolving global dynamics. It also reflects a commitment to self-determination and strategic autonomy, which are core values in American cultural and political traditions.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that the United States should indeed prioritize its alliance with Israel as a cornerstone of its Middle Eastern policy, given the shared values and strategic interests. However, this commitment must be balancedwith a nuanced understanding of the complexities in the region, recognizing the need to engage with other nations to foster stability and peace, thus ensuring that the alliance does not come at the expense of broader regional dynamics."
