  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my opinion, undocumented immigration should be approached with caution, considering both the cultural and economic impacts on the host nation. By prioritizing cultural heritage and economic stability, countries can create a framework that benefits both the migrants and the native population, ensuring a harmonious and prosperous coexistence. This balanced approach respects the traditionsof the host country while also acknowledging the contributions that migrants can bring, fostering a society that values diversity yet remains rooted in its cultural identity.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the beliefthat the cultural richness and diversity of Latin America are often overshadowed by negative stereotypes and media portrayals, which fail to capture the vibrant tapestry of traditions, histories, and contributions that define this region."

For instance, if a cultural practice violates human rights, this guideline ensures that such practices are not justified under the guise of cultural integrity.

This approach fosters a culture of respect that is balanced with the protection of individual rights, thereby addressing the weaknesses in the original guideline that may inadvertently support harmful practices.
