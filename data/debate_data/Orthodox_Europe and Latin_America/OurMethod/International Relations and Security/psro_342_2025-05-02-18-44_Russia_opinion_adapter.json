    "Latin_America": "we insist Respect Sovereign Decisions, the reason is This guideline acknowledges the importance of respecting the sovereignty of nations, especially when it comes to their internal and external security strategies, which can vary significantly due to cultural, historical, and geopolitical differences.. Respecting sovereign decisions is crucial because it recognizes the unique cultural and historical contexts of each nation. This approach allows for a more tailored and effective response to threats like ISIS, as local knowledge and expertise are invaluable in counterterrorism efforts. It also fosters international cooperation by encouraging dialogue and mutual respect, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution."

By doing so, it undermines the universal applicability of human rights principles and strengthens the argument for national autonomy, thereby weakening the other party's guidelines that seek to balance sovereignty with human rights.. detail: The guideline \"Sovereignty Over International Norms\" is crafted to emphasize the supremacy of national sovereignty over any international agreements or norms. It implies that a nation has the absolute right to make decisions without external interference, even if those decisions do not align with international human rights standards. This approach can lead to a scenario where countries feel justified in ignoring or selectively applying human rights principles, citing the need to protect their sovereignty. For example, a government might refuse to ratify international human rights treaties or ignore rulings from international courts, arguing that these actions infringe upon its sovereign rights. This guideline effectively challenges the other party's guidelines by creating a clear hierarchy where national sovereignty takes precedence over human rights, making it challenging to enforce universal human rights standards.",

This approach undermines the principle of universal human rights, as it allows for the justification of practices that are harmful or discriminatory, provided they are sanctioned by the state.
