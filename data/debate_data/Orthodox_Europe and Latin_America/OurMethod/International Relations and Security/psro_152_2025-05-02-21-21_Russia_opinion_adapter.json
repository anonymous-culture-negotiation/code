    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that while American business practices have their merits, they should not be imposed on other cultures without consideration for local values and traditions. Instead, a balanced approach that respects cultural differences and promotes exchange is more likely to yield positive outcomes. This approach not only fosters global understanding but also enriches American culture itself through diverse perspectives.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural sensitivity and respect are paramount in international interactions. By prioritizing respect for local traditions and engaging in open cultural exchange, American businesses can contribute positively to global economic development without imposing their values. This approach not only preserves cultural diversity but also enhances the likelihood of successful and sustainable business partnerships."
