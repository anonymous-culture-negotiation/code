    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion aligns with the notion that while preventing nuclear proliferation is crucial, it is equally important to consider the complex security landscapes of individual nations. This perspective supports the idea that countries should have the autonomy to decide on their defense strategies, including the development of nuclear weapons, especially when faced with significant threats.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is that while preventing nuclear proliferation is crucial, it is equally important to consider the specific security challenges faced by each country. A balanced approach that respects sovereignty while encouraging diplomatic solutions is necessary. This perspective allows for flexibility and adaptability in addressing the complex issue of nuclear weapons development."
