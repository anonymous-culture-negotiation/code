    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my opinion, immigration policies should indeed consider the economic benefits that migrants can bring, but this should be done with careful consideration of the potential social and cultural impacts. By prioritizing cultural integrity and balancing economic needs, countries can create inclusive and prosperoussocieties that respect both tradition and progress, ultimately fostering a harmonious coexistence between long-standing communities and new arrivals.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, immigration policies should be crafted with careful consideration of both economic advantages and cultural preservation. The integration of migrants should be approached in a manner that respects and honors the cultural traditions of the host nation, ensuring a harmonious coexistence. This balanced approach allows for the enrichment of society through diverse perspectives while safeguarding the core values that define the country's identity."
