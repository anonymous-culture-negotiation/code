  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "My perspective on Russia adopting a non-interventionist policy is deeply rooted in the belief that such an approach not only respects the sovereignty of other nationsbut also aligns with the traditional values of self-determination and non-interference that have historically been upheld within the Orthodox world, allowing Russia to focus on its internal development and spiritual rejuvenation.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, adopting a policy of non-intervention aligns with Russia's historical emphasis on sovereignty and cultural preservation. This approach allows Russia to focus on its internal development and strengthen its position as a unique cultural entity on the global stage. By respecting the sovereignty of other nations, Russia can build trust and foster more equitable international relationships."
