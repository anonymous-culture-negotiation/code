By prioritizing national interests, a country may justify actions that violate human rights, thus weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.. detail: The guideline \"Prioritize National Interests\" is designed to create a conflict between national priorities and universal human rights. It suggests that a nation should focus on its own interests, potentially leading to decisions that disregard international human rights norms. This approach can be justified by arguing that national interests, such as economic stability or security, take precedence over external pressures to conform to universal human rights standards.

It forces a reevaluation of how human rights are prioritized in situations where national interests are at stake, potentially leading to scenarios where human rights are compromised for the sake of maintaining or asserting sovereignty.
