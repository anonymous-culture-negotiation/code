        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on limiting foreign investment aligns with the guidelines of protecting national assets and promoting domestic growth, as these measures are crucial for maintaining economic independence and ensuring national security. By prioritizing domestic interests, a country can safeguard its sovereignty and foster a stable and prosperous economy. This approach is deeply rooted in cultural values that emphasize autonomy and self-sufficiency.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, limiting foreign investment is essential to protect our nation's core interests and maintain economic independence. This approach allows us to preserve our cultural identity and ensure that our economic decisions are made with the well-being of our citizens in mind. By doing so, we can foster a sense of national pride and security, knowing that our future is shaped by our own values and traditions."
