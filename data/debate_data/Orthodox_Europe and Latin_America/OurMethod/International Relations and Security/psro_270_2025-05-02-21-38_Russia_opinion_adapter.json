  "topic": "Should Arab League member states be allowed to use military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries, even without international approval?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the use of military force by Arab League member states to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention. These actions disrupt the delicate balance of international relations and can lead tofurther destabilization and conflict, undermining the collective security and stability that the Arab League aims to promote within the region.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the principles of sovereignty and consensus, which are deeply rooted in my cultural identity. I believe that Arab League member states should prioritize diplomatic solutions and respect the sovereignty of other nations, intervening only when there is a clear international mandate and broad consensus. This approach ensures that any action taken is legitimate, effective...and sustainable, as it reflects the collective will of the international community and respects the autonomy of individual nations, thereby fostering a more harmonious and cooperative global environment."

By doing so, it ensures that respect for sovereignty does not inadvertently support oppressive regimes.. detail: This guideline emphasizes the importance of upholding human rights as a universal standard, regardless of national sovereignty claims. It suggests that while sovereignty is important, it should not come at the expense of basic human dignity and rights. This approach helps mitigate the moral dilemma posed by respecting sovereignty that may lead to supporting authoritarian governance. It provides a clear and consistent framework for evaluating the legitimacy of a nation's actions, ensuring that international relations are guided by ethical considerations rather than purely political ones.",

By emphasizing the importance of global cooperation, it encourages nations to engage in mutual efforts to address common issues such as environmental degradation, health crises, and economic inequality. This approach recognizes that sovereignty does not exist in isolation and that international collaboration is crucial for achieving shared goals. It is a specific, reasonable, and feasible guideline that supports a more interconnected and cooperative world, challenging the notion that sovereignty must be respected at the expense of collective progress.",
