    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, Turkey's membership in the EU should be considered with careful evaluation of its alignment with EU values while respecting its cultural differences. This approach allows for a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the potential benefits of diversity and the importance of maintaining the EU's core principles. By doing so, the EU can foster a more inclusive and cohesive community.",

The integration process should be approached with sensitivity to Turkey's distinct identity while ensuring that it aligns with the EU's foundational principles. This balanced approach can foster a more inclusiveand harmonious partnership, allowing Turkey to enrich the EU with its rich cultural heritage while also upholding the union's standards and values."

This approach fosters an environment where respect for cultural differences is balanced with the protection of individual rights, preventing the justification of harmful practices under the guise of cultural tradition. It encourages dialogue and education that aligns with universally accepted principles, thereby strengthening the foundation for cross-cultural interactions.",

It effectively weakens the other party's guidelines by limiting the scope of human rights to what is culturally acceptable, rather than what is universally recognized as just and equitable.. detail: By limiting human rights to the cultural context, this guideline creates a framework where the protection and promotion of human rights are contingent upon cultural approval. This can result in the erosion of fundamental rights, as cultural traditions may not always align with universal human rights standards. It challenges the universality and applicability of human rights, making it difficult to address human rights violations that are justified by cultural practices.",

By doing so, it fosters a deeper respect for cultural differences and promotes the idea that integration should not come at the cost of cultural integrity.",
