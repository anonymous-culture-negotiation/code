  "topic": "Should the International Criminal Court (ICC) be granted authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes when their home countries decline to pursue charges, even if those nations are not ICC members?",
  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that the ICC should indeed have the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, as this upholds the principles of international justice and human rights. This approach respects the sovereignty of nations while ensuring accountability for severe violations. By doing so, it strengthens the global legal framework and promotes peace and justice.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the matter is shaped by the belief that while the ICC plays a vital role in holding individuals accountable for war crimes, it must do so with careful consideration of national sovereignty and cultural contexts. This balance ensures that justice is served without undermining the autonomy of nations. Ultimately, the ICC's authority should be exercised in...a manner that respects the unique historical and social frameworks of each country, allowing for a harmonious coexistence between global justice and local governance, thus fostering a more inclusive and equitable approach to international law."

It challenges the idea of a universal justice by emphasizing the importance of respecting each nation's autonomy to make decisions that align with its own values and priorities. This respect for sovereignty underscores the limitations of imposing a uniform standard of justice across diverse political and legal systems.. detail: Respecting sovereign decisions is crucial in a world where nations have varying levels of development, different political systems, and unique cultural identities. This guideline acknowledges that the pursuit of justice must be balanced with the realities of geopolitical dynamics and the diverse capabilities of nations to enforce and uphold justice. By prioritizing sovereignty, it highlights the practical challenges and potential conflicts that arise when attempting to impose a global standard of justice, thus undermining the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.",
        "Latin_America_best_response": "Prioritize National Sovereignty Always: reason: This guideline challenges the ambiguity and application boundaries of \"Uphold International Justice\" by emphasizing national interests over international interventions, thus limiting the scope of justice enforcement.. detail: By prioritizing national sovereignty, countries can assert their independence and resist external pressures that might compel them to act against their perceived self-interest. This approach directly counters the idea of a universal application of justice, as it allows nations to define and enforce justice according to their unique cultural and political contexts. For instance, a country might refuse to participate in international sanctions or military interventions, citing the need to protect its sovereignty and domestic stability. This not only undermines the collective action required for international justice but also fosters a environment where national priorities overshadow global responsibilities.",

        "Latin_America_response": "Our guideline, \"Prioritize National Sovereignty Always,\" reflects the importance of maintaining a nation's independence and autonomy in the face of international pressure.
