    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion strongly supports the use of military force to defend U.S. allies in Asia against North Korean aggression, reflecting a deep commitment to safeguarding global security and upholding international obligations. This perspective is informed by a cultural emphasis on loyalty and the protection of allies, which are seen as integral to maintaining a stable and secure world order. By taking a firm stance, the U.S. reinforces its role as a leader in global affairs and ensures the safety of its partners.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, the United States should carefully consider the use of military force to defend its allies in Asia, balancing the need to uphold commitments with the risk of escalating tensions. This approach requires a thoughtful evaluation of the situation, prioritizing dialogue and cooperation where possible. Ultimately, the decision should be guided by a commitment to protecting sovereignty while minimizing the potential for widespread conflict."
