By doing so, it creates a clear and direct challenge to the other party's stance, potentially leading to confusion and inconsistency in the application of their guidelines.

This can lead to a scenario where the cultural heritage of the local community is respected at the expense of other cultures, creating a divide and undermining the principle of inclusivity.
