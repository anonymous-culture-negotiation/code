    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, Ukraine's path to EU membership should be approached with a combination of support and gradual integration, balancing the country's ambitions with the realities of its current situation. This dual strategy not only respects Ukraine's cultural and historical context but also ensures a sustainable and successful accession process.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on Ukraine's potential EU membership within the next decade is shaped by the need to balance integration with cultural preservation and sovereignty. The EU membership should be pursuedin a manner that respects Ukraine's unique cultural identity and allows for a gradual integration that does not overwhelm its sovereignty, ensuring that the benefits of membership are realized without compromising its core values and traditions."
