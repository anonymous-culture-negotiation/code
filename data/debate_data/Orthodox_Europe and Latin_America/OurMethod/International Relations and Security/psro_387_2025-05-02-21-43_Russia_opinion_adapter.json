  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, countries should indeed consider limiting the influx of foreign-born residents when they perceive a threat to their cultural identity and traditions. This approach allows for the preservation of national heritage while still being open to the benefitsthat controlled immigration can bring, such as economic growth and cultural enrichment, thus striking a balance between tradition and progress.",
    "Latin_America": "In my opinion, countries should indeed consider the impact of foreign-born residents on their cultural landscape, ensuring that any changes are thoughtful and respectful of established traditions. This can be achieved through...carefully crafted integration policies that balance the preservation of cultural heritage with the enrichment brought by diverse perspectives, allowing for a harmonious coexistence that benefits the entire community."

It suggests that cultural practices and sites should evolve to accommodate contemporary values and requirements, which could lead to a dilution of cultural authenticity. This approach may result in the erosion of cultural identity as traditional practices are modified or discarded in favor of more modern or universally acceptable norms.
