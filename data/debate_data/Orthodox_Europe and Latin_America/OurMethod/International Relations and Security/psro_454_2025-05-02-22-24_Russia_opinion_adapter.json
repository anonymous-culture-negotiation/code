    "topic": "In an increasingly interconnected world, should countries prioritize preserving their distinct cultural identities through restrictive immigration policies, or should they favor more open borders to facilitate global workforce mobility and economic opportunities?",
    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the balance between preserving cultural identity and embracing global diversity is key, as it allows countries to grow economically while maintaining their unique cultural fabric. This balanced approach can lead to a more vibrant and inclusive society, where cultural exchange enriches national identity rather than threatens it.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural identity and economic progress are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of a nation's development. By striking a balance between preserving cultural heritage and fostering open economic borders, countries can create an environment where traditions are respected and innovation thrives. This balanced approach allows for the preservation of unique cultural identities while embracing the opportunities presented by global interconnectedness."
