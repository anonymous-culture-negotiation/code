    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on this topic is that national leaders should indeed visit such shrines, as it is a way to honor our cultural traditions and acknowledge our historical figures. This act does not necessarily condone the actions of these individuals but rather serves as a reminder of our collective past. By doing so, we uphold our cultural values and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of history.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, national leaders should approach these visits with a balanced perspective that respects both cultural traditions and international relations. This balance allows for the preservation of national identity while fostering global understanding and cooperation. By doing so, leaders can navigate complex historical landscapes with sensitivity and integrity."
