By fostering global cooperation, it directly challenges the \"Prioritize National\" guideline by emphasizing the importance of mutual understanding and collective action. This approach recognizes that many issues, such as climate change and economic stability, cannot be effectively managed by individual nations alone. Through global cooperation, countries can share resources, expertise, and risk, ultimately strengthening their ability to address complex problems. This guideline promotes a more interconnected and interdependent world, where national interests are balanced with global responsibilities.",

This approach helps to mitigate the risk of international condemnation and fosters a reputation for fairness and justice, which can lead to stronger, more resilient international partnerships. It also promotes internal stability by aligning national policies with the values and expectations of the global community.",
