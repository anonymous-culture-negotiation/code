    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, nations should indeed issue formal apologies for historical atrocities, but these apologies must be crafted with deep respect for the cultural traditions and narratives of all parties involved. This approach not only fosters a sense of justice and accountability but also promotes healing and reconciliation. By honoring past truths and respecting cultural narratives, apologies can become a powerful tool for brid...building bridges of understanding and fostering a collective commitment to preventing such injustices from recurring, thus contributing to a more harmonious and interconnected world.",
    "Latin_America": "we insist Respect Cultural Narratives, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the diversity of historical interpretations and the importance of cultural context in understanding past events.. Respecting cultural narratives means recognizing that different societies have unique perspectives on their history, shaped by their experiences, traditions, and values. This approach allows for a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of historical atrocities, encouraging dialogue rather than imposing a singular viewpoint. It also fosters a sense of ownership and accountability within cultures, as they reflect on their past and its impact on their present."
