Prioritizing sovereignty is crucial as it ensures the preservation of a nation's cultural identity, political autonomy, and the ability to make decisions that align with its own values and interests, rather than being influenced by external pressures.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly aligns with prioritizing territorial sovereignty, as it is crucial for preserving national identity and ensuring long-term security. Economic relationships, while important, should not overshadow the importance of maintaining control over one's territory. This stance reflects a deep respect for cultural heritage and the integrity of national borders."
