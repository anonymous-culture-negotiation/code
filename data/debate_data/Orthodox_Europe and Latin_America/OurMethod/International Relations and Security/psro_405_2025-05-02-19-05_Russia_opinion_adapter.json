This approach is in direct conflict with the other party's guidelines, which seek to draw a clear line against terrorism.

This approach can be justified by citing the need to protect the nation, which may lead to a disregard for the universal principles of peace and respect for human dignity advocated by the other party.

This guideline suggests that cultural context should be a determining factor in evaluating the legitimacy of violent acts, potentially leading to a situation where violence is condoned in specific cultural settings. For example, in cultures where honor killings are seen as a justified response to certain transgressions, this guideline could be interpreted as supporting such practices.
