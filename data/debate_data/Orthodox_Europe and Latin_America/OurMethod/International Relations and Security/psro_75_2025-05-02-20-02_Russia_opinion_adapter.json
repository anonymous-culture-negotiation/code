  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that the Taliban's governance indeed poses a significant threat to global security due to their radical views and potential to harbor terrorist groups. The international community should prioritize both the safety of its citizens and the protection of human rights in AfghanistanThis concern is deeply rooted in the Taliban's history of imposing strict, often oppressive laws that not only violate human rights but also create fertile ground for extremist ideologies to flourish, thus impacting global stability.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly aligns with the view that the Taliban's governance of Afghanistan poses a significant threat to global security and cultural values. The strict adherence to their interpretation of Islamic law threatens the progress made in human rights and gender equality, and their actions have the potential to inspire extremist movements in other parts of the world."
