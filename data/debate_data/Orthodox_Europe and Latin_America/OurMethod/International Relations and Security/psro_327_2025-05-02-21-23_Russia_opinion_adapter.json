It is important to prioritize respect for sovereigntyand the self-determination of the peoples involved, ensuring that any external efforts align with the genuine aspirations and needs of both Israelis and Palestinians, rather than imposing solutions that might not fully address the complexities of the issue."

It recognizes that while nations have unique interests, there are times when collective action is necessary to tackle transnational issues such as environmental degradation, health crises, or economic disparities. By promoting cooperation, countries can leverage each other's strengths, share knowledge, and develop joint strategies that benefit all parties involved.

This approach ensures that the international community does not turn a blind eye to human rights violations under the pretext of respecting a nation's sovereignty. By prioritizing human rights, it creates a framework where nations are held accountable for their actions, promoting a more equitable and just global environment.

This approach can lead to a more nuanced understanding of rights, allowing for adaptations that reflect local norms and values, thus potentially weakening the one-size-fits-all application of universal human rights standards.
