This openness fosters trust and accountability, making it more difficult for any nation to justify actions that disrespect the sovereignty of others under the guise of protecting their own.. detail: The guideline \"Promote Transparency In International Actions\" aims to enhance trust and cooperation among nations by advocating for clear and open communication. It encourages countries to be forthcoming about their policies and actions, ensuring that all parties involved are aware of the intentions and consequences of these actions. This transparency can help prevent misunderstandings and misinterpretations that might lead to conflicts, thereby strengthening the foundation for respectful and collaborative international relations.

For instance, a country might justify restrictive policies on freedom of speech or assembly as necessary to maintain social stability or protect economic interests, thereby undermining the principles of human rights.

By doing so, it highlights the potential for conflict between respecting state autonomy and protecting human rights, revealing the limitations and contradictions within the original framework.
