  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, while historical claims hold significant cultural and emotional value, they should not justify the violation of internationally recognized borders, as this could lead to instability and conflict. Instead, nations should engage in diplomatic efforts to address these claimsand work towards mutually beneficial agreements that respect the sovereignty of all parties involved, fostering a more harmonious and cooperative environment within the region.",
    "Latin_America": "In my opinion, countries should not pursue territorial expansion based on historical claims, as this approach can lead to conflicts and undermine global stability. Respecting sovereign borders and prioritizing peaceful coexistence are essential principles that guide international relations and ensure that nations can thrive without encroaching on the rightsof others, fostering an environment where cooperation and mutual understanding can flourish."

By placing human rights at the forefront, it creates a moral and ethical framework that questions the absolute nature of border respect, especially in cases where such respect might lead to suffering or injustice.. detail: Implementing a guideline that prioritizes human rights ensures that actions taken by nations are scrutinized based on their impact on individuals and communities. This approach fosters a culture of accountability and empathy, encouraging international cooperation and dialogue to resolve conflicts that might arise from border disputes. It also promotes a more inclusive understanding of sovereignty, one that balances national interests with global responsibilities and ethical considerations.",

By promoting engagement and mutual understanding, this principle encourages nations to address their differences through diplomacy rather than resorting to isolation or confrontation. This approach can help mitigate the challenges posed by varying interpretations of sovereignty and facilitate the development of shared solutions to global challenges.

It encourages countries to approach dialogue with a clear-eyed view of the potential challenges posed by territorial disputes.
