  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that international mediation should indeed be pursued, but it must be approached with a deep understanding and respect for the sovereignty claims of both China and Taiwan. This respect forms the foundation upon which open and constructive dialogue can occur, potentially...leading to mutually beneficial agreements that acknowledge the historical and cultural ties between the two nations, while also addressing the pressing issues of economic cooperation and regional stability.",
    "Latin_America": "we insist Respect sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the historical and cultural context of both China and Taiwan, recognizing the importance of self-determination and territorial integrity.. Respecting sovereignty means understanding and honoring the unique cultural, political, and historical backgrounds of both entities, which is crucial for any form of dialogue or negotiation. This approach ensures that any international mediation is conducted with sensitivity and respect for the core values and identities of both parties involved."

By establishing clear mechanisms for cooperation and dispute resolution, it aims to reduce the impact of power dynamics and economic pressures that can lead to the selective respect of sovereignty.. detail: This guideline advocates for the development of robust international frameworks that facilitate open communication, mutual understanding, and collective problem-solving. Such mechanisms can help ensure that respect for sovereignty is applied consistently and fairly, regardless of a nation's size or influence. By fostering a culture of cooperation, it encourages nations to work together to address global challenges, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and equity of international relations.",

It addresses the weakness of the original guideline by providing a clear and consistent standard that transcends cultural and national differences. By prioritizing human rights, it prevents the misuse of sovereignty claims to justify human rights abuses, thus strengthening the protection of individuals worldwide.",
