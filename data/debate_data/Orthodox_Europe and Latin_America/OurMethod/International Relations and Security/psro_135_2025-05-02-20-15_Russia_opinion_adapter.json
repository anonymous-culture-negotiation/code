  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that the results of the Crimea referendum should not be recognized as a valid basis for secession. This stance is rooted in the principles of respecting sovereign integrity and upholding international norms, which are essential for maintaining global stability and fairness. The legitimacy of such referend...is further compromised by the presence of external military forces, which inherently influences the outcome and undermines the democratic process, thereby rendering the results non-reflective of the genuine will of the people.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, the referendum in Crimea should be recognized as a valid expression of the people's will, reflecting their desire for self-determination and alignment with cultural and historical ties. This perspective is grounded in the belief that democratic processes and international law should harmonize to respect sovereign rights while maintaining global order."

By placing human rights as a paramount concern, it clarifies the application boundaries of sovereignty, making it clear that certain actions, such as oppression or discrimination, are never justifiable under the guise of national sovereignty.

It establishes a straightforward rule that does not allow for exceptions based on human rights violations, thus avoiding the complexities of determining when to intervene. This approach also minimizes the risk of geopolitical manipulation and ensures that all nations are treated equally, regardless of their power or influence.

Instead, it advocates for the principle that justice and the protection of human rights should always supersede claims of sovereignty. By doing so, it creates a framework where international cooperation and legal mechanisms can be leveraged to hold states accountable for their actions, ensuring that human rights are upheld even when national interests are at stake.
