By prioritizing national interests, a country may justify actions that violate human rights, thus undermining the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines.. detail: This guideline suggests that a nation should place its own interests above the commitment to universal human rights. For example, if a country believes that enforcing certain human rights would lead to economic instability or political unrest, it could use this guideline to justify non-compliance. This approach exploits the ambiguity in the other party's guidelines regarding the balance between sovereignty and human rights, allowing for a more self-serving interpretation of international obligations.",

By doing so, it eliminates the ambiguity and confusion that can arise from trying to balance these two principles. For instance, if a country decides to enforce laws that restrict certain freedoms in the name of national security, this guideline would support such actions, even if they are perceived as violating human rights. This approach maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by providing a clear and definitive stance that prioritizes sovereignty, thus reducing the room for negotiation and compromise on human rights issues.",
