    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the EU should foster a spirit of voluntary cooperation and mutual support rather than enforce mandatory financial aid, allowing countries to contribute based on their capabilities and priorities. This approach aligns with the value of respecting each nation's sovereignty and economic strategy. By doing so, the EU can promote a more balanced and sustainable form of solidarity among its members.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, the idea of obligatory financial aid within the EU poses significant risks and undermines the principles of accountability and self-sufficiency. It is crucial for each member state to prioritize its own economic health and make decisions that align with its unique cultural and financial circumstances. By doing so, the EU can foster a more resilient and balanced economic environment where cooperation is voluntary and mutually beneficial."

This approach fosters a culture of reliability and trust, both within the organization and among the communities it serves, thereby enhancing its credibility and effectiveness in crisis situations.
