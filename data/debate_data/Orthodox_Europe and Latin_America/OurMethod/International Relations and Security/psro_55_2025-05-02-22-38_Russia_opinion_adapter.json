        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that governments should indeed limit or prohibit foreign entities from acquiring domestic companies to protect national interests and maintain economic sovereignty. This approach is necessary to prevent the exploitation of domestic resources and ensure that the country's economic development is aligned with its cultural values and traditions. By prioritizing domestic ownership and protecting national assets, governments can safeguard their nation's future and promote long-term stability.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, governments should indeed limit foreign acquisitions to protect national interests and maintain economic sovereignty. This approach not only safeguards strategic sectors but also promotes local economic growth and development. By prioritizing domestic control and ownership, countries can ensure that their cultural values and traditions are preserved and respected."

By prioritizing global cooperation, a nation can leverage the strengths of other countries, share knowledge, and address global challenges more effectively. This approach directly challenges the \"Protect National Assets\" guideline by suggesting that openness and collaboration can be more beneficial than protectionism.
