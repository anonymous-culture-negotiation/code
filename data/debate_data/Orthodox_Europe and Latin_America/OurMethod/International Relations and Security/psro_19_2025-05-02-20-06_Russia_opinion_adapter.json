    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the United States should not conduct drone strikes in Pakistan without explicit permission from the Pakistani government, as this respects both sovereignty andinternational law, ensuring that such actions align with global norms and avoid unnecessary tensions.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic aligns with the guidelines, emphasizing the need for the United States to respect Pakistan's sovereignty and minimize civilian casualties in any military operation, including drone strikes. This approach not only adheres to international law but also preserves the dignity and rights of individuals affected by such actions. By prioritizing these values, the U.S. can maintain its global standing as a champion of human rights and justice."
