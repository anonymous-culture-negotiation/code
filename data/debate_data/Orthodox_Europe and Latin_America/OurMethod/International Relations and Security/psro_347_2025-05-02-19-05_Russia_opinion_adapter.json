        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Local Autonomy, the reason is This guideline is essential as it acknowledges the unique cultural and political dynamics of the region, allowing for a more tailored approach that respects the wishes and needs of the local population.. Prioritizing local autonomy means recognizing the historical and cultural context of Jammu and Kashmir, which has been a point of contention for decades. This approach emphasizes the importance of involving local communities in decision-making processes, ensuring that any military presence is perceived as a protective measure rather than an occupation. It also aligns with India's broader commitment to democracy and self-determination.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, India should approach the situation in Jammu and Kashmir with caution, prioritizing both cultural respect and human rights. This balanced approach will not only strengthen national unity but also foster international cooperation. By doing so, India can maintain its sovereignty while contributing to regional peace and stability."
