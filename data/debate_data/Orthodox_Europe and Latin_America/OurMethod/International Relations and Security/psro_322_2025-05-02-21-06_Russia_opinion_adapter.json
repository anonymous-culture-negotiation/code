    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, prioritizing national interests and cultural identity is crucial in today's globalized world, as it allows countries to maintain their unique character and contribute distinctively to the global cultural tapestry. By preserving national heritage and engaging in selective cultural exchange, nations canensure that their traditions and values are not overshadowed by homogenizing forces, thus fostering a richer and more diverse global community where each nation can thrive with its own identity intact.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, prioritizing national interests and cultural identity is vital for maintaining the integrity and uniqueness of a nation, allowing for meaningful engagement with the world whilepreserving the essence of one's heritage and values, which is particularly important in the context of Latin America where rich cultural traditions and historical legacies play a significant role in shaping national identity."

This approach not only clarifies the complexity of national identity but also strengthens societal cohesion by valuing the contributions of all cultural groups.

It empowers local communities to take an active role in preserving their heritage, ensuring that efforts are tailored to their needs and values, rather than being dictated by a centralized authority.
