        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion strongly aligns with the notion that Iran should not be allowed to develop and possess nuclear weapons, as this aligns with the broader goal of maintaining global security and adhering to non-proliferation treaties. The potential for nuclear conflict in such a geopolitically sensitive region is too great, and it is our collective responsibility to prevent such outcomes. By advocating for a nuclear-free Iran, we uphold a cultural tradition that values peace and stability above militaristic expansion.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guideline that Iran should not be allowed to develop and possess nuclear weapons, as this aligns with the broader goal of maintaining international peace and adhering to non-proliferation treaties. The potential for nuclear conflict outweighs any perceived benefits of nuclear deterrence, emphasizing the need for diplomatic solutions and international cooperation. This perspective is deeply rooted in the cultural value of prioritizing collective well-being over national ambitions."

It advocates for a pragmatic approach where nations prioritize their security interests, which may include maintaining a nuclear arsenal as a necessary evil to deter aggression.
