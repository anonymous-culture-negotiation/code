        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Sovereignty Always, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the importance of allowing nations to self-determine their political systems without external interference, which is a fundamental principle of international relations and respect for cultural diversity.. The concept of respecting sovereignty is deeply rooted in the belief that each country has the inherent right to choose its own governance model, reflecting its unique historical, cultural, and social context. This approach fosters global stability and prevents conflicts that may arise from imposing one's political ideology on another nation. It also recognizes the complexity and diversity of political systems worldwide, encouraging dialogue and cooperation rather than confrontation.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, the United States should prioritize respecting the sovereignty of other nations, recognizing their right to choose their own political systems. This approach not only aligns with the principles of international law and diplomacy but also reflects a genuine respect for cultural diversity and the complexities of governance. By doing so, the U.S. can build stronger, more equitable relationships with other countries, fostering a global environment where cooperation and mutual understanding thrive."

It implies that any attempt to intervene, whether through diplomatic pressure or military action, is unjustified.
