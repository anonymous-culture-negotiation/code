    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that sovereignty should be respected while also considering the protection of human rights. The guidelines highlight the importance of balancing these two principles, acknowledging that each situation requires careful consideration of the potential consequences of interventionThis nuanced approach reflects the understanding that while national sovereignty is a cornerstone of international relations, it cannot supersede the moral obligation to safeguard human dignity and prevent suffering, thus necessitating a thoughtful and multi-faceted evaluation of each scenario.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, the principle of national sovereigntyis crucial in the context of Latin America, as it reflects the region's historical struggle for independence and self-determination, allowing countries to assert their unique cultural identities and governance models without external interference."
