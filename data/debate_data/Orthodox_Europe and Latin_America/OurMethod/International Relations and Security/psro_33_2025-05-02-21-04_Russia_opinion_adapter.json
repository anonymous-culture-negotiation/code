  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, Turkey should indeed prioritize strengthening its relationships with European Union member states and NATO allies, as this alignment supports its cultural and democratic aspirations. However, this should not come at the expense of its connections with the Middle East, where shared history and geography play a significant role. By balancing these relationships, Turkey can leverage its strategic position to enhance both its internal stability and external influence.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, Turkey should prioritize strengthening its relationships with European Union member states and NATO allies, as these partnerships have historically provided a framework for stability and economic growth. However, it is also important to respect regional diversity and engage in dialogue with Middle Eastern countries to foster cooperation and mutual understanding. This balanced approachwould allow Turkey to navigate its unique geopolitical position effectively, leveraging its cultural and historical ties to both Europe and the Middle East to promote peace and prosperity in the region."
