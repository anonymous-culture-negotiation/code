  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the notion of launching preemptive military strikes is fraught with ethical and practical concerns, as it undermines the principles of sovereignty and non-aggressionthat are foundational to international relations, and it risks escalating conflicts rather than resolving them, leading to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic consequences for all parties involved.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, the concept of launching preemptive military strikes contradicts the fundamental values of respect and cooperation that are essential for a harmonious world. The principle of respecting sovereignty should guide nations in their interactions, encouraging them to seek peaceful resolutions and avoid actions that could escalate tensions. This approach not only preserves international stability but also upholds the dignity and autonomy of all nations involved."

It acknowledges that while sovereignty is crucial, it should not come at the expense of individual and community well-being. By incorporating human rights into the equation, it provides a framework for intervention when necessary, such as in cases of severe human rights violations, while still maintaining respect for a nation's autonomy.

It considers the context and potential consequences of inaction, allowing for a more pragmatic approach to conflict resolution.

This framework should be based on internationally recognized principles and should take into account the potential consequences of such actions.
