  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the implementation of immigration restrictions targeting majority-Muslim countries is not justifiable as it contradicts the values of respect and inclusivity that are central to fostering a cohesive and secure society. By prioritizing human rights and cultural respect, nations can develop more effective and sustainable security strategies that do not alienate or marginal...ize specific communities, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious and equitable social environment where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and contribute positively.",
    "Latin_America": "In my opinion, implementing immigration restrictions based on religion is counterproductive and undermines the core values of equality and respect. Such policies can lead to social division and mistrust, ultimately weakening national cohesion and security. By embracing diversity and fostering inclusivity, nations can create a stronger, more resilient society."
