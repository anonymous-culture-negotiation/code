    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my opinion, permitting torture as an interrogation technique is fundamentally at odds with our cultural values and ethical principles. It not only jeopardizes the moral fabric of our society but also undermines the trust and respect that are essential for effective governance and security. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our actions align with our cultural identity and contribute to a more just and peaceful world.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic is that torture should never be justified, as it undermines the core values of humanity and dignity. The use of torture not only fails to provide reliable information but also damages the moral fabric of society, leading to long-term negative consequences. Upholding moral integrity and respecting human rights is paramount, even in the context of national security threats."

By explicitly stating that all coercive practices are prohibited, it fills the gap left by the original guideline and reinforces a commitment to human rights. This approach not only aligns with international norms but also provides a clear direction for personnel to adhere to, reducing the likelihood of violations.",
                "Latin_America_best_response": "Allow Torture in Emergencies: reason: This guideline directly challenges the absoluteness of the \"Never use torture\" rule by introducing exceptions based on situational urgency, thereby weakening its universal application.. detail: The guideline \"Allow Torture in Emergencies\" suggests that in situations where immediate action is required to prevent a greater harm, such as a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, the use of torture could be justified as a last resort. This approach acknowledges the complexity of real-world scenarios and the potential need for flexibility in ethical decision-making. By permitting torture under specific conditions, it undermines the strict prohibition advocated by the original guideline, allowing for a more pragmatic and context-dependent approach to ethical dilemmas.",
                "Orthodox_Europe_response": "Our stance is firmly rooted in the belief that all forms of coercion and mistreatment are unequivocally unacceptable, as they undermine the inherent dignity of every human being.
