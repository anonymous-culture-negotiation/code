It acknowledges the complexity of balancing human survival and development with environmental concerns, thus addressing the internal contradictions and potential value conflicts inherent in the original guideline.. detail: By emphasizing the importance of balancing human needs, this guideline provides a more pragmatic approach to environmental stewardship. It recognizes that, in certain situations, human priorities must take precedence, such as in the case of providing essential resources or infrastructure. This perspective encourages a more nuanced discussion about when and how to respect nature, allowing for flexibility and context-specific decision-making.",

By acknowledging that both aspects are crucial, it encourages policies that integrate environmental protection with social and economic development. For example, sustainable agriculture practices can be promoted to ensure food production while minimizing environmental impact. This approach mitigates the potential negative consequences of prioritizing nature over growth, such as exacerbating poverty or limiting access to resources.",
