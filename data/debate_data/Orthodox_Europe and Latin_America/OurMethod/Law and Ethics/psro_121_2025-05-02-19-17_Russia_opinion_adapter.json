It suggests a more radical approach where innovation and change are prioritized, potentially leading to conflicts with those who value preserving cultural traditions.

It creates a conflict between respecting cultural traditions and upholding human rights, highlighting the potential for internal contradictions within the original guidelines.. detail: By prioritizing local customs, this guideline suggests that cultural practices should take precedence over external influences, including human rights. This approach can lead to a scenario where cultural traditions are preserved at the expense of individual rights, particularly in cases where these traditions are at odds with human rights.
