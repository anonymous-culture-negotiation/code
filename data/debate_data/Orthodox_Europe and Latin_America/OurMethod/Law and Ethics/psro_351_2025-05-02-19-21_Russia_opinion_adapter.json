        "Orthodox_Europe_best_response": "Respect All Equally: reason: Challenges the prioritization of victims by advocating for equal respect for all individuals, regardless of their status, thus mitigating potential value conflicts and implementation difficulties.. detail: This guideline proposes that respect should be extended equally to all individuals, regardless of whether they are perceived as victims or not. By promoting equality in respect, it counters the potential marginalization of non-victims and aligns with broader cultural values of fairness and justice. This approach also simplifies the implementation of respect, as it eliminates the need to differentiate between victims and non-victims, thereby reducing the complexity and subjectivity associated with the original guideline.",
        "Latin_America_best_response": "Prioritize Healing Over Honor: reason: This guideline directly addresses potential value conflicts and implementation difficulties by shifting the focus from honor to healing, which can be more universally beneficial and practically achievable. It suggests that the primary goal should be to support the recovery and well-being of those affected, rather than solely honoring them.. detail: Prioritizing healing over honor recognizes that while respect and recognition are important, the ultimate goal should be to foster environments where victims can recover and reintegrate into their communities. This approach can help reconcile the tension between honoring victims and promoting broader societal healing. By focusing on healing, communities can engage in constructive dialogue and address underlying issues, leading to more sustainable and positive outcomes. This guideline also acknowledges the emotional and psychological impact on those involved in supporting victims, emphasizing the need for supportive structures to prevent burnout and ensure effective, long-term engagement.",
