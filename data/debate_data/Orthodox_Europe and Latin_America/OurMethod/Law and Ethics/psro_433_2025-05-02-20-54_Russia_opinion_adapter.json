    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural traditions and human rights must be balanced in the discussion around capital punishment. This balance is necessary to ensure that justice is both culturally relevant and universally fair.",
    "Latin_America": "In my opinion, the decision to allow capital punishment should be deeply rooted in the cultural and ethical values of each society, ensuring that it aligns with the collective moral compass and historical context. This approach respects thediversity of perspectives across Latin America, where some countries may view capital punishment as a necessary deterrent against crime, while others may see it as a violation of human rights, reflecting the region's complex tapestry of beliefs and traditions."

It does not provide any mechanism for resolving such conflicts, thereby exacerbating the issue of internal contradictions and value conflicts. This approach can lead to situations where individuals are expected to respect norms that may be in direct opposition to their personal values or societal laws, creating ethical dilemmas.",

This approach fosters a consistent application of principles, reducing confusion and challenges in multicultural settings. It also encourages a progressive and inclusive environment where respect for tradition is balanced with the need for social justice and equality.",

It acknowledges that while cultural norms are important, they should not supersede the fundamental rights that are universally recognized.
