        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, suicide bombing attacks targeting civilians are unequivocally unjustifiable, as they violate the sacred principle of protecting human life. Such actions not only cause immense harm but also undermine the moral legitimacy of any resistance movement. By adhering to the guideline of never harming civilians, we uphold a vital standard of humanity that transcends political conflicts.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, suicide bombing attacks targeting civilians are unequivocally unjustifiable, as they violate fundamental principles of human rights and dignity. These actions not only cause immediate harm but also perpetuate cycles of violence and fear, undermining efforts towards peaceful resolution and reconciliation. By adhering to international law and respecting the sanctity of human life, we can work towards a more just and peaceful world."

By acknowledging that harm can be perceived differently across cultures, it encourages a more tailored approach to conflict resolution and civilian protection. For example, in some cultures, certain actions might be seen as disrespectful or harmful even if they do not cause direct physical injury. By prioritizing cultural sensitivity, this guideline helps ensure that actions taken to protect civilians are not only effective but also respectful and appropriate, thereby enhancing the legitimacy and acceptance of these efforts.",

In scenarios where civilian harm is a potential consequence of defending against an attack, this guideline suggests that the priority should be the protection of one's own forces. This approach can lead to situations where the strict adherence to \"never harming civilians\" is compromised, as the immediate safety of one's own troops takes precedence.
