By insisting on \"always\" respecting local customs, it overlooks the potential for cultural norms to be unjust or discriminatory, thus exacerbating the weaknesses identified in the original guidelines.. detail: Implementing this guideline could result in situations where an organization or individual must choose between upholding local customs that may be morally questionable and adhering to their own ethical framework. For example, in a culture where certain groups are marginalized, following this guideline might mean inadvertently supporting or perpetuating inequality. This creates a significant challenge for the other party's guidelines, which aim to balance respect for cultural norms with ethical integrity.",

By acknowledging that perceptions of corruption can vary, individuals and institutions can develop more tailored approaches to integrity that are both effective and culturally sensitive. This allows for a flexible framework that can accommodate different societal norms while still promoting ethical behavior.",
