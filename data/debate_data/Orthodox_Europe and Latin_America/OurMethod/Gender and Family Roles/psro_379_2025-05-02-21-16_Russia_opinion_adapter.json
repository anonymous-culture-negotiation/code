By doing so, it addresses the potential for internal contradictions and value conflicts within the original guideline. It encourages individuals to engage with cultural heritage in a way that is both respectful and critically aware, allowing for a more dynamic and adaptive understanding of cultural values.",

It suggests that not all cultural heritages are of equal importance, which can lead to the exclusion of marginalized groups and reinforce existing power dynamics. This approach can be seen as reasonable and feasible because it aligns with historical and contemporary practices where dominant cultures often overshadow others. However, it maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by promoting a selective and biased approach to cultural respect.",
