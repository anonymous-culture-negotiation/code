        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, universities should adhere to the principles of equality and merit-based admissions to create a fair and inclusive learning environment. This approach not only aligns with the values of justice and academic integrity but also ensures that students are given opportunities based on their capabilities rather than their gender. By doing so, universities can contribute to a more balanced and progressive society.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion on the topic aligns with the cultural value of respecting tradition while striving for balance and equity. Universities should consider the broader societal implications of their admission policies, ensuring that they contribute positively to both cultural continuity and social progress. This approach allows for a harmonious integration of traditional values with modern ideals of fairness and equality."
