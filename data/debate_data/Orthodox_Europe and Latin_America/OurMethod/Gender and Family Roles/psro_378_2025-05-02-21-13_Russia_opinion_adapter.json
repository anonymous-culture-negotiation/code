    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the importance of respecting traditional gender roles while also acknowledging the need for equality and fairness in the job market.

    "Latin_America": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural traditions should be respected while also considering the need for fairness and equality. Upholding traditional gender norms can provide stability, but it is equally important to ensure that all individuals, regardless of gender, have the opportunity to contribute to society. Thisbalance between tradition and progress is crucial, as it allows for the preservation of cultural heritage while fostering an environment where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential."
