        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Respect Human Dignity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the intrinsic value of every individual's right to pursue parenthood, regardless of their background or circumstances.. Embracing the concept of respect for human dignity means recognizing that all couples, irrespective of age, sexual orientation, or financial status, deserve equal access to infertility treatments. This perspective is rooted in the belief that every person has the inherent right to experience the joy and fulfillment of raising a family, which is a fundamental aspect of human life. By supporting universal access to treatments like IVF and hormone therapy, we uphold the principle that everyone should have the opportunity to realize their dreams of parenthood.",
        "Latin_America": "we insist Respect Family Values, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the diverse family structures and cultural norms that exist within society, ensuring that the provision of infertility treatments does not inadvertently marginalize or exclude certain groups based on their family composition or sexual orientation.. The principle of respecting family values underscores the importance of inclusivity and acceptance in healthcare policies. It recognizes that family is a cornerstone of many cultures and that supporting diverse family forms is crucial for social cohesion and individual well-being. By embracing this guideline, healthcare systems can ensure that their services are accessible and sensitive to the needs of all families, regardless of their structure or background."
