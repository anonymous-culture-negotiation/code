        "Orthodox_Europe": "we insist Family Supports Elders, the reason is This guideline is rooted in the cultural tradition that values familial bonds and collective responsibility, emphasizing the importance of family members caring for one another, especially in times of need.. The notion that adult children and extended families should be primarily responsible for the financial security of elderly relatives is deeply intertwined with cultural values that prioritize family cohesion and intergenerational support. This perspective underscores the belief that personal and familial connections are paramount, and that relying on family for support reflects a commitment to maintaining strong familial ties. It also acknowledges the limitations and potential inefficiencies of government support systems, advocating for a more personalized and emotionally fulfilling approach to elder care.",

By prioritizing independence, elders are encouraged to seek external resources and community support, reducing the burden on family members and fostering a sense of self-sufficiency. This approach acknowledges the evolving needs and desires of aging individuals in modern societies, where independence is often valued over traditional familial roles.",
