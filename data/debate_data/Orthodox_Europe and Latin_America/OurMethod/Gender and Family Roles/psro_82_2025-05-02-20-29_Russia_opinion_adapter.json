It encourages individuals to consider whether certain practices align with contemporary values of equality and justice. By doing so, it fosters a culture of critical thinking and ethical awareness, ensuring that respect for tradition does not equate to blind acceptance of potentially detrimental customs.

This approach directly confronts the ambiguity present in the original guidelines, which attempt to balance these two elements without providing clear direction on how to resolve conflicts. By prioritizing cultural norms, it forces a reevaluation of how individual rights are perceived and implemented within cultural contexts, potentially leading to a more cohesive but restrictive cultural framework.",
