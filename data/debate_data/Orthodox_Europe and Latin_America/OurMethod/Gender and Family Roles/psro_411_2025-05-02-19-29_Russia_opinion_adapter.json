    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, teaching domestic skills to all students is crucial for fostering a society where gender roles are not rigidly defined, allowing individuals to choose their paths freely. This approach not only aligns with modern values of equality but also respects the cultural traditions that have shaped our communities.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly supports the idea that schools should not limit the teaching of domestic skills to any particular gender, as this can inadvertently perpetuate outdated gender norms. By providing equal access to these skills, we can ensure that future generations are equipped to navigate a diverse and evolving world. This approach aligns with the values of equality and personal freedom, allowing individuals to pursue their passions without being constrained by societal expectations."

By doing so, it aims to create a learning environment that is inclusive and reflective of the students' backgrounds, thereby increasing their interest and connection to the material. This approach is not only culturally sensitive but also enriches the learning experience by providing students with a broader understanding of the world. It is feasible to implement through collaborations with community organizations, cultural events, and the development of culturally responsive teaching materials.
