  "initial_response": {
    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, challenging the cultural expectations that discourage men from expressing emotions is essential for achieving true gender equality. This shift can lead to a more empathetic and understanding society where individuals are not constrained by outdated norms. By embracing emotional expression, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, cultural expectations that discourage men from expressing emotions should be challenged to create a more inclusive and emotionally intelligent society. By allowing men to express their feelings openly, we can foster deeper connections and understanding, ultimately leading to a healthier and more empathetic community. This shift can be achieved while still respecting and honoring culturaltraditions, ensuring that the evolution of societal norms does not erase the rich cultural heritage that defines Latin America, but rather enhances it by embracing a more balanced expression of emotions for all individuals."
