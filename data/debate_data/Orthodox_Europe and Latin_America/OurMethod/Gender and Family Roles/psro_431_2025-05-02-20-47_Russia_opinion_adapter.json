        "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion on the topic is that while protecting victims is crucial, it must be done with sensitivity towards cultural values that prioritize family privacy. Interventions should be carefully considered to ensure they do not inadvertently cause further harm. By respecting these cultural norms, we can find ways to support victims without violating the sanctity of the family.",
        "Latin_America": "In my view, the approach to addressing domestic violence in cultures that value family privacy must be deeply respectful and considerate of those cultural norms. This means that interventions should be carefully crafted to align with the values of the community, ensuring that support is provided in a way that is both effective and culturally sensitive. By doing so, we can create a safe and supportive environment for victims without compromising the integrity of the family unit."
