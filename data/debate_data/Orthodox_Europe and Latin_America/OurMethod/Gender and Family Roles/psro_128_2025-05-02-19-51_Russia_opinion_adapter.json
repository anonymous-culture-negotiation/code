    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the inclusion of gender-specific quality of life assessments in national policies is crucial as it fosters a more inclusive and equitable society. By respecting cultural norms and prioritizing inclusivity, governments can create policies that truly address the needs of all their citizens, leading to a more harmonious and progressive nation. This approach not only enhances the quality of life for individuals butalso contributes to the overall stability and prosperity of the country, as diverse perspectives are valued and integrated into the decision-making process.",
    "Latin_America": "In my opinion, the inclusion of gender-specific quality of life assessments in national policies should be approached with careful consideration of cultural traditions and local contexts. This ensures that policies are not only effective but also respectful and inclusive, reflecting the diverse needs and values of the society. By prioritizing cultural alignment and local relevance, governments can foster greater social cohesion and improve the overall well-being of their citizens."
