    "Orthodox_Europe": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle of equality, as it is essential for creating a just and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to succeed based on their abilities. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that gender should not be a barrier to professional advancement. By upholding equality, we can ensure that workplaces are both fair and competitive.",
    "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly supports the idea that employers should not prioritize male candidates for high-salary positions, as this practice undermines the fundamental principles of gender equality and fairness. By adhering to guidelines such as equal opportunity and merit-based selection, organizations can ensure that theirworkforce is diverse and inclusive, thereby fostering an environment where talent and potential are the sole determinants of success, rather than gender."

By allowing for merit-based decisions in key roles, it can help reconcile the potential conflict between equality and other cultural values such as freedom and tradition.",
