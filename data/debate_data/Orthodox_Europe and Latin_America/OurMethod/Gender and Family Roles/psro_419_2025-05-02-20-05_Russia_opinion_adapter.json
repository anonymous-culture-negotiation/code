    "initial_response": {
        "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, the idea of permitting abuse to maintain traditional gender roles is unacceptable. It contradicts the principles of equality and respect that are essential for a healthy and harmonious marriage. By promoting mutual respect and understanding, we can build stronger, more resilient relationships that honor the dignity and worth of all individuals involved.",
        "Latin_America": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle that physical or emotional abuse within a marriage is never justifiable, as it fundamentally violates human rights and dignity. Upholding respect and equality in marriage is crucial for fostering healthy and harmonious relationships. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that all individuals deserve to live free from fear and abuse."
