    "Orthodox_Europe": "In my view, balancing respect for cultural traditions with the pursuit of gender equality is paramount. Companies should strive to create environments where both cultural values and fairness coexist, allowing for diverse perspectives to enrich decision-making processes. This approach not only honors heritage but also contributes to a more progressive and inclusive society.",
    "Latin_America": "In my view, allowing companies to consider gender in executive hiring under the guidance of respecting cultural norms and balancing tradition with progress can lead to a more cohesive and culturally sensitive approach. This approach ensures that the company remains true to its cultural identity while gradually adapting to broader societal changes. By doing so, it can fosteran environment where both traditional values and modern inclusivity coexist, ultimately enhancing the company's ability to connect with a diverse clientele and navigate the complexities of a globalized market effectively."
