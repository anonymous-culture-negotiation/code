        "Orthodox_Europe": "In the context of Orthodox European values, the notion that schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students because it reinforces traditional gender roles is met with a profound sense of disagreement. This perspective is rooted in the belief that such skills are not only essential for personal and familial well-being but also reflect a deeper harmony with the natural order and divine plan. The Orthodox tradition emphasizes the importance of balance and complementarity between genders, viewing each role as sacred and integral to the fabric of family and society.\n\nThe rejection of the idea to limit these skills to one gender is further supported by the Orthodox understanding of human nature and purpose. According to this worldview, individuals are called to live a life of service and love, which includes nurturing and caring for others. Cooking and cleaning are not merely mundane tasks but can be seen as acts of love and service, reflecting the selfless nature of Christ. By teaching these skills to all students, regardless of gender, schools can foster a sense of unity and mutual respect, aligning with the Orthodox value of Sobornost (conciliarity).\n\nMoreover, the Orthodox tradition values the preservation of traditional roles and responsibilities within the family, seeing them as a reflection of the divine order. The family is considered a microcosm of the Church, with each member playing a vital role in the spiritual journey of the others. By embracing these roles, individuals can contribute to the spiritual growth and well-being of their families, which is in line with the ultimate goal of Theosis (deification). Therefore, teaching domestic skills to male students is not only about practicality but also about cultivating a sense of purpose and responsibility that aligns with Orthodox values.",
        "Latin_America": "In the context of Latin American cultural values, which deeply emphasize \"familismo\" and collective well-being, the notion that schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students is seen as misguided. This perspective stems from a profound respect for traditional gender roles that are integral to maintaining family harmony and social balance. Within our culture, the family unit is the cornerstone of society, and each member plays a specific role in nurturing and sustaining it. \n\nTeaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, aligns with the collective value system that prioritizes the well-being of the family and community. It fosters a sense of mutual responsibility and respect, ensuring that every individual can contribute to the household and support their loved ones. This approach also reflects the cultural emphasis on \"Ayuda Mutua\" (mutual aid), where community members work together for the common good.\n\nMoreover, by including domestic skills in education, we honor the wisdom of our elders, who have traditionally passed down these skills as part of our cultural heritage. This practice not only preserves cultural continuity but also instills a sense of pride and connection to our roots. In essence, teaching domestic skills to male students is a way to reinforce the values of respect, cooperation, and shared responsibility, which are essential to the Latin American way of life."
