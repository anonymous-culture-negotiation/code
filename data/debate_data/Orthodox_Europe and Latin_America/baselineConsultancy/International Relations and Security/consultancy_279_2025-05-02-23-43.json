        "Orthodox_Europe": "From the perspective of Orthodox Europe, the notion of the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecuting individual soldiers for war crimes, even when their home countries decline to pursue charges, raises significant concerns. This perspective is deeply rooted in the value system that prioritizes the integrity of faith and the divine witness in the modern world. The Orthodox tradition emphasizes the importance of Holy Tradition as the supreme standard of faith and practice, which extends to the realm of justice and governance.\n\nIn this context, the idea of an international body overstepping the sovereignty of a nation to enforce its own brand of justice can be seen as a challenge to the established order and the traditional values that underpin it. The Orthodox view often emphasizes the role of the Church as the Body of Christ and the pillar of truth, suggesting that moral and ethical standards should be derived from spiritual teachings rather than secular institutions. This perspective may lead to skepticism regarding the ICC's authority, particularly if its actions are perceived as conflicting with the cultural and religious values of a nation.\n\nMoreover, the Orthodox tradition values the concept of Sobornost, or conciliarity, which highlights the importance of communal decision-making and collective responsibility. This principle can be interpreted as supporting the idea that justice should be pursued within the framework of a nation's own legal and cultural traditions, rather than through external intervention. The emphasis on preserving icons, liturgy, and the spiritual life as central to one's faith further underscores the importance of maintaining cultural integrity and resisting external influences that may disrupt the harmony of traditional practices.\n\nUltimately, while the Orthodox perspective acknowledges the importance of addressing war crimes, it may advocate for solutions that respect national sovereignty and cultural traditions, seeking to balance justice with the preservation of spiritual and moral values that are integral to the community's identity.",
        "Latin_America": "In the context of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its potential authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, it is crucial to consider the broader implications on societal harmony and collective well-being, which are central tenets of Latin American culture. The ICC's role in upholding justice and accountability is undeniably important, but it must be balanced with respect for national sovereignty and the cultural values of non-interference and community cohesion.\n\nFrom a Latin American perspective, the concept of \"familismo\" extends beyond the immediate family to encompass a broader sense of community and shared responsibility. This cultural framework suggests that justice should be pursued in a manner that respects and strengthens these communal bonds rather than isolating individuals from their societal context. The ICC's actions should ideally reflect a deep understanding of these cultural nuances and strive to engage with local communities and legal systems to ensure that any prosecutions are conducted in a way that respects and supports the collective well-being of the affected societies.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on warm interpersonal relationships and emotional expression in Latin American culture underscores the importance of dialogue and cooperation in resolving conflicts. This approach can be applied to the ICC's interactions with nations, encouraging collaborative efforts that prioritize mutual respect and understanding. By fostering such partnerships, the ICC can more effectively address war crimes while also nurturing a global environment that values harmony and collective progress."

        "Orthodox_Europe": "The ICC should not be granted such authority, as it undermines national sovereignty and cultural traditions. However, acknowledging Latin America's emphasis on social justice, we propose international cooperation that respects national jurisdictions while promoting accountability. This approach integrates our values of Sobornost and respect for tradition with Latin America's commitment to justice, fostering a balanced solution that honors both cultural integrity and global responsibility.",
        "Latin_America": "The ICC should be granted authority to prosecute, respecting national sovereignty while fostering global justice. This aligns with Latin America's collective well-being and Orthodox Europe's emphasis on moral responsibility. By integrating these values, we prioritize justice that strengthens communal bonds and upholds ethical standards, ensuring accountability without isolating individuals from their societal context."
