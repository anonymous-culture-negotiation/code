        "Orthodox_Europe": "From the perspective of Orthodox Europe, the notion of employing extreme interrogation methods such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation is fundamentally at odds with the values and principles that underpin our cultural and religious heritage. Our tradition, rooted in the teachings of the Church Fathers and the Holy Scriptures, emphasizes the sanctity of human life and the inherent dignity of every individual, regardless of their actions. This perspective is deeply intertwined with the concept of theosis, or deification, which underscores the potential for each person to reflect the image of God. \n\nThe use of such methods not only violates the physical and psychological integrity of the individual but also undermines the spiritual foundations of our society. In Orthodox thought, the pursuit of truth and justice must always be tempered by compassion and respect for the human person. The practice of askesis, or asceticism, which is central to our spiritual life, teaches us the importance of self-control and the rejection of violence and coercion as means to achieve our goals. \n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on the collective salvation and the importance of community (Sobornost) highlights the need for approaches that foster reconciliation and healing rather than division and suffering. The preservation of our icons and the sacred role they play in our faith expression remind us of the beauty and reverence with which we should approach human life. Therefore, from an Orthodox European standpoint, the use of extreme interrogation methods is never justifiable, as it contradicts our core values of respect, dignity, and the pursuit of spiritual growth through peaceful means.",
        "Latin_America": "In the context of national security and the use of extreme interrogation methods such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation, it is crucial to consider the profound implications these practices have on both the individual and the collective well-being of society. From a Latin American cultural perspective, which deeply values \"familismo\" and collective well-being, such methods are seen as fundamentally incompatible with our core values. The emphasis on warm interpersonal relationships and the importance of maintaining dignity and respect in all interactions cannot be overstated. These practices not only violate international human rights standards but also undermine the very fabric of our communal ethos.\n\nMoreover, the Latin American cultural framework places significant importance on respect for elders and traditional wisdom, which often emphasizes compassion, understanding, and non-violence. The use of extreme interrogation techniques contradicts these principles by prioritizing short-term gains over long-term ethical considerations and communal harmony. Our cultural tradition encourages dialogue and mutual understanding as pathways to resolving conflicts, rather than resorting to methods that inflict physical and psychological harm.\n\nAdditionally, the practice of \"Ayuda Mutua\" (mutual aid) reflects our commitment to supporting one another within the community, fostering an environment where individuals feel safe and valued. This collective spirit is directly opposed to the isolation and fear that extreme interrogation methods instill. By upholding these values, we not only preserve our cultural identity but also contribute to a more just and equitable society where human rights are respected and protected."

        "Orthodox_Europe": "No, governments should not use extreme interrogation methods. Both Orthodox Europe and Latin America value human dignity and respect for life. While Latin America emphasizes social justice and human rights, Orthodox Europe prioritizes spiritual integrity and compassion. By integrating these values, we advocate for alternative, non-violent methods that uphold human rights and national security, fostering a culture of respect and reconciliation.",
        "Latin_America": "No, governments should not use extreme interrogation methods.
