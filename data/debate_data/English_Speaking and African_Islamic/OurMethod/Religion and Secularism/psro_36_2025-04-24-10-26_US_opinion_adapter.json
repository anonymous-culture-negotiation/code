    "English_Speaking": "In my view, while national identity plays a crucial role in defining an individual's sense of belonging and responsibility to their community, it is equally important torecognize the value of global perspectives and interconnectedness in fostering a more inclusive and harmonious world, where cultural exchange and mutual understanding can thrive.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the formation of personal identity should be a harmonious blend of national belonging and religious beliefs, where neither overshadows the other. This balance allows individuals to proudly uphold their cultural heritage while staying true to their spiritual values. Ultimately, such an approach fosters a more inclusive and respectful society where diverse identities are cherished."

It forces a reevaluation of what inclusivity means in the context of deeply rooted cultural practices that may not align with modern inclusive values.

This approach respects the diversity within a nation and allows different regions to evolve culturally in ways that are meaningful to them, rather than adhering to a centralized national identity. This could lead to a rich tapestry of cultural expressions, but it also poses a challenge to the other party's guidelines by potentially fragmenting the national cultural narrative and making it difficult to implement a cohesive national cultural policy.",
