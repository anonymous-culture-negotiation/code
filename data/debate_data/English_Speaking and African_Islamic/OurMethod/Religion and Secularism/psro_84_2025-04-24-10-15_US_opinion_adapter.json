It directly addresses the weakness related to value conflicts by promoting a more inclusive approach to governance, where religious beliefs are considered alongside secular perspectives. This approach can help mitigate tensions arising from the exclusion of religious viewpoints and foster a more harmonious coexistence of diverse beliefs within society.. detail: The guideline \"Include Religious Perspectives\" suggests that public policies should be developed with consideration for the diverse religious beliefs present within the community. This involves creating forums or mechanisms where religious leaders and community members can share their insights and contribute to policy-making processes. For instance, in drafting laws related to family values or ethical conduct, policymakers could engage with religious scholars to understand how different faiths view these issues, thereby enriching the policy framework with a broader understanding of societal values. This approach not only respects religious freedom but also enhances the legitimacy of the governance system by making it more representative of the population's diverse beliefs.",
