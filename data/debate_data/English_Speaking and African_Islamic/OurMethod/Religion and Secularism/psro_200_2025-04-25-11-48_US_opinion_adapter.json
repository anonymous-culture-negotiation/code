        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the idea that religious institutions should not have an expanded role in governmental decision-making in countries with diverse religious populations. This stance is rooted in the belief that such involvement could lead to religious bias and undermine the democratic principles of equality and freedom. By keeping the government separate from religious influences, we can ensure a more just and equitable society for all citizens.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that religious institutions should not have an expanded role in governmental decision-making to uphold the principles of secularism and equality. This ensures that governance remains impartial and that all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliations, are treated fairly and have equal opportunities. By maintaining this separation, countries can foster a more harmonious and inclusive society where diverse religious populations can coexist peacefully."
