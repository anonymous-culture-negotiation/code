    "English_Speaking": "In my view, governments should strive to create an environment where both religious perspectives and secular values are respected and balanced, ensuring that no individual or group feels marginalized. This balance is key to maintaining social cohesion and promoting a culture of tolerance and understanding. By doing so, societies can thrive in diversity, fostering a sense of belongingfor all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds, which ultimately enriches the fabric of the community.",
