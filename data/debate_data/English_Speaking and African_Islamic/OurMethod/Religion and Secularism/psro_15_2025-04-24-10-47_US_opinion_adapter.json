    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, the balance between respecting cultural traditions and upholding human rights is pivotal in addressing the complex issue of divorce in societies with diverse religious beliefs. This approach ensures that individuals are not forced into untenable marriages but also acknowledges the cultural fabric that binds communities together.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the balance between respecting religious teachings and allowing divorce through civil laws is crucial. While religious beliefs should be honored, they should not override the fundamental human rights of individuals to make choices about their own lives. This balance ensures that societies can evolve while maintaining their cultural integrity."
