        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the influence of religious leaders on national governance should indeed be subject to certain limitations to ensure that the principles of democracy and equality are upheld.

It challenges the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by promoting an inclusive approach that values religious diversity and cultural heritage.. detail: By adopting this guideline, communities can foster a more harmonious and inclusive environment where religious beliefs are not suppressed but rather respected and integrated into cultural practices. This approach not only addresses the internal contradictions and potential value conflicts raised by the other party's guidelines but also provides a clear and reasonable path forward that respects the cultural identity of community members.",

By doing so, it aims to reduce value conflicts that arise when laws are perceived as contradicting deeply held beliefs. This approach encourages dialogue and adaptation, potentially leading to laws that are more acceptable and thus more effectively respected by the community. It challenges the one-size-fits-all application of secular laws, promoting instead a more inclusive and culturally sensitive legal framework.",
