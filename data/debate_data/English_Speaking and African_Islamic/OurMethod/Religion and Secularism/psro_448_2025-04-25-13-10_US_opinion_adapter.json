It effectively weakens the effectiveness of the original guideline by promoting a selective approach that may exclude non-traditional family forms.. detail: The guideline to prioritize traditional family models suggests that communities should focus on supporting and recognizing family structures that align with historical and cultural norms, such as the nuclear family. This approach can lead to a more cohesive community identity but may come at the cost of marginalizing families that do not fit this mold. For instance, in educational settings, curricula might emphasize traditional family roles, potentially leaving out diverse family representations and experiences, thus undermining the inclusive intent of the original guideline.",
