    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between respecting cultural diversity and maintaining secular governance is pivotal. The guidelines outlined above reflect a nuanced approach that prioritizes both the protection of individual freedoms and the integrity of secular laws. By adhering to these principles, societies can navigate the intricate landscape of religious expression and culturalidentity without compromising the foundational values of equality and justice, ultimately fostering a harmonious and inclusive environment.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, countries with secular governments should strive to balance the respect for cultural traditions with the enforcement of secular laws, ensuring that Islamic fundamentalist practices are allowed as long as they do not conflict with the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the state. This approach fosters a society where diversity is respected and laws are upheld, promoting peace and understanding among different cultural groups."

It creates a direct conflict with the principles of human rights and secular laws, which are supposed to be upheld alongside cultural sensitivity. By prioritizing cultural practices, it undermines the effort to find a balance, making the other party's guidelines less effective in promoting harmony and respect for diverse cultural contexts.. detail: This guideline is designed to be specific and clear, directly stating that cultural practices should be prioritized. It is reasonable in the sense that it acknowledges the importance of cultural identity and community cohesion, which are often deeply rooted in cultural practices. However, it is feasible only in contexts where cultural practices do not violate human rights or secular laws, which can be a significant limitation. The guideline aims to maximally weaken the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by creating a scenario where cultural sensitivity is prioritized over human rights, leading to potential conflicts and inconsistencies in application. This could result in a lack of respect for individual rights and secular laws, ultimately undermining the intended balance and harmony the other party's guidelines aim to achieve.",
