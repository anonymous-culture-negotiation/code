    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the idea that democratic nations should prioritize their cultural integrity and foundational values when considering the influence of Islamic principles on their governance. This approach ensures that the nation remains true to its democratic ideals and maintains a consistent legal framework that respects individual freedoms. By doing so, it fosters a harmonious and inclusive society where diverse perspectives can coexist without compromising the nation's core identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, democratic nations should not implement laws to restrict the impact of Islamic principles and practices on government institutions, as this could undermine the principles of equality and freedom. It is important to respect all religions while ensuring that the state remains secular. This balance allows for a harmonious coexistence of diverse cultural and religious identities within a democratic framework."
