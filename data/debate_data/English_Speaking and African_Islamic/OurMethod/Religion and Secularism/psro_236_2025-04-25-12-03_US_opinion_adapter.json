        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the allowance of Muslim women to wear niqabs or burqas in public institutions, as it aligns with the principles of cultural freedom and inclusivity. These guidelines reflect a commitment to respecting individual choices and promoting a harmonious, diverse society. By embracing these values, we can create a more inclusive and equitable environment for all.",

It is crucial to respect and uphold the cultural identity of individuals, including Muslim women who choose to wear full-face coverings, as it is a fundamental aspect of their religious and cultural expression. This respect ensures that diverse cultural traditions are preserved and valued within the society."
