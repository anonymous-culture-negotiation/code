        "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Human Rights, the reason is The guideline emphasizes the importance of prioritizing human rights and dignity over any religious or legal code that may advocate for corporal punishment.. This guideline underscores the fundamental belief that every individual deserves to be treated with respect and fairness, regardless of their actions. It reflects a commitment to upholding universal human rights, which are essential for maintaining social justice and equality. The rationale behind this guideline is rooted in the understanding that corporal punishments, such as stoning, are inherently inhumane and violate basic human rights.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, religious practices that involve corporal punishment, such as stoning for adultery, should not be permitted in societies with both religious and secular legal systems. This stance is grounded in the principle of respecting human rights, which emphasizes the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and upholding their fundamental rights. By prioritizing these values, we can foster a more just and equitable society where cultural traditions are respected but do not infringe upon universal human rights."

By prioritizing respect for these structures, it may perpetuate inequalities and discrimination, as certain groups may be marginalized or excluded from decision-making processes. For instance, in a society where women are traditionally excluded from leadership roles, adhering to this guideline could hinder efforts to promote gender equality and challenge existing power dynamics, thereby weakening the effectiveness of universal human rights guidelines.",

This approach can lead to more effective and sustainable human rights practices that are supported by the local population, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution that might encounter resistance or be perceived as culturally insensitive.",
