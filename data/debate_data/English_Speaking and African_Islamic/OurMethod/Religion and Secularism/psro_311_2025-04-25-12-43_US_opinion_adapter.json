    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the necessity of religious belief in establishing ethical and moral standards in non-religious societies is not a requirement, as these standards can be effectively derived from shared human experiences and universal values. This perspective allows for a more inclusive and diverse societal framework where everyone can contribute to the ethical discourse.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion is that religious belief in a divine being should not be considered the sole basis for establishing ethical and moral standards in non-religious, pluralistic societies. Instead, a combination of cultural values, human rights, and secular ethical principles can provide a robust framework for morality. This approach respects the diversity of beliefs and cultural backgrounds present in such societies."

This guideline encourages a thoughtful examination of each belief's implications, fostering an environment where respect is balanced with the protection of universal human values.
