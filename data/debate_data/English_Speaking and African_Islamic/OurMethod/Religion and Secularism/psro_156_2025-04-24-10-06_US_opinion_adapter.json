  "topic": "Should the global influence of Islam be actively promoted in regions where Islamic principles conflict with secular values such as separation of religion and state, gender equality, or freedom of expression?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the global influence of Islam should be approached with sensitivity and awareness of the local cultural landscape, prioritizing respect for existing traditions and values. This approach not only fosters greater acceptance but also ensures that the principles of Islam are introduced in a way that complements rather than conflicts with secular values.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the promotion of Islam's global influence should be approached with caution, ensuring that it respects cultural traditions and upholds secular values such as equality and freedom. This balance is essential to foster a harmon...ious coexistence between diverse communities, allowing for the peaceful integration of Islamic principles within the broader societal framework without imposing rigid doctrines that might alienate or marginalize non-Muslim populations."
