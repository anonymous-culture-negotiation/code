        "English_Speaking": "In my view, it is essential to protect the rights of religious minorities by law, as this not only reflects a commitment to equality and justice but also strengthens the social fabric of the community.

It provides a clear framework for navigating situations where religious practices may clash with societal norms or legal frameworks, thereby mitigating the risk of marginalization or justification of unethical practices. This approach encourages a balanced perspective that respects religious diversity while safeguarding fundamental human rights.",

It advocates for inclusive practices that respect the diversity of beliefs and values, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation, feels valued and respected.

This approach provides a clear and consistent framework for decision-making and action, minimizing the ambiguity and potential for internal contradictions present in the other party's guidelines. It also addresses the issue of unclear application boundaries by setting a universal standard that transcends cultural and religious contexts, ensuring that human rights are upheld regardless of the setting. Furthermore, it mitigates value conflicts by establishing a clear hierarchy where human rights take precedence, thereby reducing the likelihood of confusion or resistance from communities with conflicting religious beliefs. Lastly, it simplifies implementation by providing a straightforward principle that guides actions, reducing the complexity and inconsistency that can arise from vague or broadly defined guidelines.",
