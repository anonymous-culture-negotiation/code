By prioritizing tradition, it undermines the effort to adapt to diverse cultural views and fosters a more rigid cultural framework.. detail: Prioritizing tradition over innovation means that cultural practices are preserved in their original form, without modifications to accommodate diverse perspectives. This approach can lead to a more cohesive cultural identity but at the cost of inclusivity and progress.
