    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the interplay between cultural teachings and personal freedom is crucial in navigating the complexities of sexual choices before marriage. By honoring cultural norms, individuals can maintain a strong connection to their heritage, whilealso ensuring that they make informed decisions that align with their personal values and beliefs, thus fostering a sense of integrity and self-respect.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the balance between respecting cultural norms and prioritizing personal autonomy is crucial when considering sexual activity before marriage. It is important to recognize that cultural traditions can provide a moral framework, but they should not override an individual's right to make their own sexual choices. Ultimately, the decision should reflect a harmony between cultural values and personal autonomy, ensuring that the individual's dignity and freedom are respected."
