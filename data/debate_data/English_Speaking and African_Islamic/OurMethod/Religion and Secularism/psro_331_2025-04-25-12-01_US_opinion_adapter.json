        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing religious organizations to influence government policies can lead to a form of moral coercion that undermines individual freedoms and the principles of democracy. By separating church and state, we protect the rights of all individuals to practice their beliefs freely without imposing them on others. This separation is crucial for maintaining social harmony and ensuring that governance is based on rational, evidence-based decision-making rather than religious dogma.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist No Influence Allowed, the reason is To maintain secular governance integrity, it is crucial that religious organizations do not influence government policies, ensuring that laws are based on the collective needs of the populace rather than specific religious doctrines.. This guideline is essential to uphold the principles of democracy and prevent any single religious group from imposing its beliefs on the broader population, thereby respecting the diversity of cultural and religious identities within the nation."
