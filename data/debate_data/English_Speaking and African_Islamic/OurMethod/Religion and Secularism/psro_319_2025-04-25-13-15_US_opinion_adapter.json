    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this matter is firmly grounded in the belief that violence against non-combatants is never justifiable, as it contradicts the foundational principles of respect, empathy, and the preservation of human dignity. The use of violence in such contexts not only undermines moral authority but also perpetuates cycles of hatred and suffering. Ultimately, the path of non-violence is the most noble and effective way to promote any ideology, fostering dialogue and understanding rather than fear and division.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, violence against non-combatants is never justifiable, as it contradicts the fundamental principles of respect, compassion, and justice that are central to most religious and cultural ideologies. The use of violence not only harms innocent lives but also undermines the moral authority and credibility of the religious ideology being promoted. By adhering to the guideline of never harming innocents, we can ensure that religious beliefs are upheld and respected in a manner that promotes peace and unity."

It suggests that while the general rule is to protect, there are situations where harm might be justified if it prevents greater danger. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of innocence and threat, enabling decision-makers to act based on concrete assessments rather than abstract moral absolutes.",

It promotes a flexible approach to balancing these values, which can help address the potential value conflicts and implementation difficulties faced by the original guideline.. detail: By advocating for the dynamic balancing of values, this guideline recognizes that real-world situations often require trade-offs and compromises. It encourages individuals to consider the broader ethical landscape and make decisions that reflect a thoughtful and adaptive approach to upholding multiple values simultaneously. This flexibility can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions, ultimately undermining the effectiveness of a guideline that does not account for such complexities and nuances.",
