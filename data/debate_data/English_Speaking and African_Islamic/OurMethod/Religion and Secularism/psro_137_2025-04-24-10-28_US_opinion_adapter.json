    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principles of freedom and equality, advocating for a society where no one is compelled to adhere to a particular religion to be considered a full citizen. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that diversity enriches a nation and that individual rights should be paramount. By embracing these values, a country can truly reflect the principles of justice and fairness.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that a country should not legally require its citizens to follow or identify with the majority religion to be recognized as full citizens. This stance is supported by the guidelines that emphasize respect for cultural diversity and the importance of not making religious affiliation compulsory. By allowing individuals the freedom to choose their religious identity, a nation fosters a more inclusive and democratic environment."
