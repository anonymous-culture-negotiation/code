        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that while cultural beliefs and values are important, they should not overshadow the critical role of evidence-based approaches in public health policy-making. Effective health policies must balance cultural sensitivity with scientific rigor to achieve the best possible outcomes.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, while religious beliefs and doctrines are integral to many individuals' identities, they should not override evidence-based secular approaches in determining access to contraception and family planning services. It is essential to strike a balance that respects cultural traditions while prioritizing the health and well-being of the community. By integrating both cultural sensitivity and scientific evidence, public health policies can be more effective and inclusive."
