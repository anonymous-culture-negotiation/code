    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing religious organizations to heavily influence political decisions undermines the foundational principles of democracy and equality, as it can lead to favoritism and discrimination against those who hold different beliefs. Therefore, it is crucial to uphold the separation of church and state to ensure a fair and just society for all citizens.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle of maintaining a secular governance system where religious organizations do not have a major impact on political decisions. This ensures that policies are inclusive and equitable for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. By prioritizing cultural harmony and the separation of church and state, we can create a society that respects both religious freedom and democratic values."
