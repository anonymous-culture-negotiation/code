    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the government should not actively encourage Islamic practices if it means compromising on secular principles, as this could lead to societal divisions and undermine the rights of non-Muslim citizens. Instead, fostering an inclusive environment where all religions can coexist peacefully is crucial. This approach not only respects the cultural identity of Muslim citizens but also strengthens the fabric of a pluralistic society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, governments should not impose religious practices but rather support cultural expressions that are authentic and meaningful to Muslim citizens, ensuring that secular principles are upheld while respecting religious diversity. This approach allows for a balanced integration of cultural and religious values within the framework of national identity."
