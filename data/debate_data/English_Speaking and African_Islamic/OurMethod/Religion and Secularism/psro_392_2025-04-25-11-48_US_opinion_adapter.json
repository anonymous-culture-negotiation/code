  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, promoting a single religion by government institutions undermines the principles of equality and fairness, which are essential for a harmonious society. By adhering to guidelines like respecting all faiths equally and separating church and state, we can create a more inclusive environment where diversity is valued. This approach not only respects individual freedoms but also strengthens the social fabric by encouraging mutual respect and understanding among different religiousgroups, ultimately fostering a cohesive and progressive community that thrives on its diversity.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, promoting one religion over others in government institutions can undermine the principles of equality and justice that are fundamental to a peaceful society. Therefore, it is essential to uphold the guideline of respecting all religions to ensure that every individual feels valued and included, regardless of their religious beliefs. This approach not only honors cultural diversity but also strengthens the social fabric of the nation."
