  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, implementing stringent restrictions on religious practices, especially those associated with Islam, is not an effective strategy for countering extremism. It is crucial to uphold the principles of equality and respect for all faiths, ensuring that no religion is unfairly targeted. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive society where diversity is celebrated and the risk of alienation and radicalis minimized, allowing for a more harmonious coexistence among people of different religious backgrounds.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, implementing stringent restrictions on religious practices, especially those associated with Islam, is not a viable solution to counter extremism. It is crucial to respect cultural identity and promote inclusive dialogue to foster a harmonious and understanding society, where freedom of religion is balanced with security measures. By doing so, we can address the root causes of extremism more effectively."
