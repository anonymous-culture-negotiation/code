  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports incorporating religious studies and theology into the curriculum, as it reflects a commitment to preserving cultural identity and fostering moral values. However, this should be done in a way that complements, rather than overshadows, the importance of practical subjects. By finding this balance, education can be truly holisticThis approach not only enriches students' understanding of their heritage but also equips them with a broader perspective on life, allowing them to navigate diverse social and professional environments with empathy and integrity.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the emphasis on religious studies and theology in public schools should be approached with a balance that respects both cultural traditions and the need for practical skills. This balanced approach ensures that students are well-prepared for their future roles in society. By integrating cultural heritage with modern educational needs, we can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment."

By doing so, it creates an environment where cultural heritage is preserved without the influence of human rights awareness, potentially leading to the continuation of practices that infringe upon human rights.
