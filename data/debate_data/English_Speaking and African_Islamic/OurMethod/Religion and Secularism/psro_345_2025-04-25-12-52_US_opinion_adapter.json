        "English_Speaking": "In my view, ethical behavior and moral standards should not be contingent upon belief in a divine being, as this approach respects individual freedoms and fosters a more inclusive society. It allows for a broader understanding of morality that encompasses various cultural and personal beliefs, promoting tolerance and cooperation.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the requirement of belief in a divine being for ethical behavior undermines the principles of cultural integrity and secular ethics, which are crucial for a harmonious and diverse society. By focusing on shared human values and cultural traditions, we can establish robust moral standards that respect individual beliefs and promote unity. This approach allows for a more inclusive and equitable societal framework."
