    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the notion that religious leaders should not have a formal advisory role in government policies, as it could lead to biased decision-making and undermine the principles of equality and freedom. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that governance should be based on rational, evidence-driven approaches rather than religious dogma. By maintaining this separation, we can ensure that policies are crafted to benefit the entire populace, irrespective of their religious beliefs.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that while religious leaders should not hold a formal advisory role in government, their participation in community discussions can enrich policy debates with diverse ethical perspectives, ensuring that policies resonate with the cultural values of the nation. This approach respects both the separation of church and state and the importance of cultural identity in governance."
