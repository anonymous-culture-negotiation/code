    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, Turkey's membership in the EU should be contingent upon its ability to harmonize its cultural heritage with the EU's secular and democratic principles. This balance is crucial for maintaining the integrity of both Turkey's identity and the EU's values. Ultimately, a thoughtful and gradual integration process can foster mutual respect and understanding.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on Turkey's potential membership in the EU is that it should be considered with caution, ensuring that the integration process respects Turkey's cultural heritage and adheres to EU integration conditions, thus fostering a mutually beneficial relationship. This approach allows for a balanced view that acknowledges both the cultural differences and the shared values that can strengthen the EU. By prioritizing these aspects, the EU can create an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes unity."
