    "English_Speaking": "In my view, while scientific evidence should primarily guide public policy to ensure effectiveness and practicality, it is equally important to consider the ethical and moral implications that religious beliefs bring to the table. This balancedapproach allows for a more holistic understanding of complex issues, where the rigor of science is complemented by the depth of moral and ethical considerations, ultimately leading to policies that are both informed and compassionate.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, while respecting cultural and religious traditions is crucial, scientific evidence should predominantly influence public policy to ensure that decisions are made with the objective of improving the quality of life for everyone. This balance allows societies to evolve harmoniously, respecting both individual beliefs and collective well-being. By prioritizing science, we can address global issues more effectively and create a future where cultural values and scientific progress coexist in harmony."
