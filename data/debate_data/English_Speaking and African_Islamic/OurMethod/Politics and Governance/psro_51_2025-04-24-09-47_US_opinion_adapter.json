  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the guidelines that advocate against recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate government due to their egregious human rights violations. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that upholding universal human rights and promoting gender equality arefundamental principles that should never be compromised, and thus, any form of recognition or support for the Taliban would be tantamount to condoning their oppressive practices.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion aligns with the guideline of not recognizing the Taliban due to their egregious human rights record, emphasizing the importance of upholding global standards of equality and justice. The international community should prioritize the welfare and rights of the Afghan people over political expediency."
