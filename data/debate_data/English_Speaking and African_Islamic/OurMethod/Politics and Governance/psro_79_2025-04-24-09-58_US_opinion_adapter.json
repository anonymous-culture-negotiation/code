        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, the balance between national security and press freedom is crucial, as it reflects the delicate dance between protecting citizens and upholding democratic values. While national security must be safeguarded, the media's role in holding power accountable is indispensable. Ultimately, a thoughtful and nuanced approach is necessary to reconcile these competing interests.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, media organizations should not have the unconditional right to publish classified information related to national security. This stance is guided by the principle of respecting national security and maintaining a balance between transparency and secrecy, ensuring that the safety and well-being of the citizens are prioritized while still upholding the values of a free press."
