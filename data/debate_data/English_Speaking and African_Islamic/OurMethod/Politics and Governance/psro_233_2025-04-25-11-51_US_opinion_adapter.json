    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that cultural harmony and national unity are foundational to a thriving society, where the expression of individual thoughts must be tempered by consideration for the common good. This perspective is deeply rooted in the value of community cohesion, which is often prioritized in traditional societies. Ultimately, striking a balance between freedom and stability is essential for long-term societal prosperity.",
