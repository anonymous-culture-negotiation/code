        "English_Speaking": "In my view, unemployment is largely influenced by systemic factors such as economic downturns, lack of job opportunities, and discriminatory practices, which are beyond individual control. This perspective aligns with cultural values that prioritize social welfare and equitable access to resources. By acknowledging these systemic issues, we can work towards creating a more supportive environment that fosters employment opportunities for all.",
