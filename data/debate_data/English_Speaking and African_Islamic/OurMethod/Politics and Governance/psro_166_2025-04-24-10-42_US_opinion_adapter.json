    "English_Speaking": "In my view, Venezuela should continue to uphold the principles of Chavismo, as it embodies the nation's commitment to social justice and independence.

It addresses the potential value conflicts and internal contradictions by clearly stating that contemporary ethical standards should override cultural heritage when they clash.. detail: By prioritizing modern values, this guideline ensures that cultural preservation efforts do not inadvertently support outdated or discriminatory practices. It promotes a forward-thinking approach that respects cultural heritage while adapting to societal changes, thus weakening the other party's guidelines that struggle with balancing tradition and innovation.",
        "African_Islamic_best_response": "Emphasize Economic Diversification: reason: Challenges the rigid adherence to socialist ideologies by promoting a mixed economy that can better adapt to global market fluctuations and reduce dependence on a single economic model.. detail: This guideline encourages the exploration of various economic strategies, including private sector involvement and foreign investment, to strengthen the national economy and make it more resilient against external pressures. By fostering a diverse economic base, the country can mitigate the risks associated with over-reliance on a single ideology, thereby weakening the other party's guidelines that prioritize maintaining Chavismo at all costs.",
