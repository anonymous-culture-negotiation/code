    "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing political organizations that contradict human rights principles to form governments undermines the foundational values of equality and justice. Upholding human rights is crucial for fostering a society where all individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination or oppression. This stance reflects a commitment to the universal values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, political organizations that contradict internationally recognized human rights principles should not be allowed to form governments, as their ideologies could lead to systemic violations of human rights and undermine societal well-being. The formation of such organizations should be restricted to safeguard democratic integrity and ensure that governance aligns with the values of equality and justice. This stance is crucial for maintaining a just and equitable societyThus, it is imperative that we prioritize the protection of human rights and democratic values over any political ideology that seeks to undermine these principles, ensuring that governance is fair and just for all citizens."

It encourages a culture of acceptance and non-interference, which can lead to greater harmony and personal fulfillment, as individuals feel empowered to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs.

It ensures that the universal principles of human dignity and rights are upheld consistently, even when they encounter diverse perspectives that may challenge them.
