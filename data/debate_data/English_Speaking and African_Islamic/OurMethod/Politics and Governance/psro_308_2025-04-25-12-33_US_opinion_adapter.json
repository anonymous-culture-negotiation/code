  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between national security and press freedom is a delicate one, requiring careful consideration of the potential consequences of censorship. While there may be instances where limiting media content is necessary to protect public safety, these actions should be subject to rigorous scrutiny and transparent justification to ensure they do not infringe upon fundamentalrights, as the preservation of a free press is essential for holding power accountable and fostering an informed citizenry.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the authority of governments to censor media outlets should be approached with caution, prioritizing the protection of press freedom while acknowledging the need for balanced measures to ensure national security. This balance is crucial to maintain the integrity of democratic institutions and public trust."

It demands a clear decision-making process that favors safety over journalistic expression, which can be at odds with the other party's guidelines that aim to protect press freedom.
