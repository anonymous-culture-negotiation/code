        "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Authority, the reason is Upholding societal order is crucial.. Prioritizing respect for law enforcement reflects a commitment to maintaining social stability and trust in institutional systems, which are foundational to many cultural traditions that emphasize respect and obedience to authority figures. This approach ensures that any form of protest or demonstration is conducted in a manner that does not undermine the rule of law but seeks constructive dialogue and reform. It underscores the importance of working within established frameworks to bring about change, reflecting a pragmatic and orderly approach to addressing grievances.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, while demonstrations can be a powerful tool for change, they should be conducted in a manner that respects the law and existing governmental structures. This approach ensures that the message against police misconduct is conveyed effectively without undermining the institutions that are crucial for societal harmony. By aligning protests with cultural values of respect and non-violence, we can work towards systemic improvements that benefit everyone."
