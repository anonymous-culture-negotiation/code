    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, acts of political violence should not be justified as they undermine the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for human rights, which are integral to fostering a harmonious society. Instead, non-violent resistance and dialogue offer more effective and sustainable paths to addressing grievances and promoting change.",
        "African_Islamic": "we insist Never Justify Violence, the reason is Violence undermines the moral high ground and risks harming innocent lives, which is contrary to the principles of most cultural traditions that value peace and community well-being.. Acts of political violence, such as bombings or shootings, are never justifiable as they not only cause physical harm but also create an environment of fear and mistrust. This guideline emphasizes the importance of non-violent resistance and dialogue in achieving political change, aligning with cultural values that prioritize the safety and dignity of all individuals. It encourages protesters to seek legal and peaceful means to express their grievances and work towards solutions that respect both government authority and cultural traditions."
