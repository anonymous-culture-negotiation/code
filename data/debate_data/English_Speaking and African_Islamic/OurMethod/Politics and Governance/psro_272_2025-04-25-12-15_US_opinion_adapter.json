By prioritizing specific cultural practices, it creates a scenario where the guidelines' intention to respect all cultures equally is compromised, leading to potential conflicts and inequalities.. detail: Implementing this guideline would involve identifying specific cultural practices deemed worthy of prioritization and allocating resources accordingly. This could lead to a situation where resources are disproportionately allocated to support one cultural group's practices, potentially at the expense of others. For instance, in a workplace, prioritizing a cultural practice that involves regular communal gatherings might overshadow the needs of employees from cultures that value private celebrations, thus creating an imbalance in how different cultures are respected and accommodated.",

This could hinder efforts to promote equality and justice within cultures, ultimately weakening the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines that aim to balance cultural diversity with universal rights.",
