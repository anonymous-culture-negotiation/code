  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, governments should have the authority to restrict media content when it threatens the social fabric, as maintaining harmony and stability is essential fora cohesive society, and this can sometimes require limiting the dissemination of information that could incite violence or discord.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, while governments may have a role in guiding media content to ensure it aligns with cultural values, it is important to strike a balance that respects individual freedoms of expression. The key is to foster a media environment that is both culturally sensitive and open to diverse perspectives."
