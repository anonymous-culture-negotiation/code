        "English_Speaking": "In my view, electing racial or ethnic minority candidates as national leaders is a step towards creating a more inclusive and progressive society, where diversity is celebrated and every voice matters. This approach not only aligns with the principles of equality and justice but also enriches the cultural fabric of the nation, ensuring that leadership reflects the pluralistic nature of its people.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the election of racial or ethnic minority candidates as national leaders should be approached with careful consideration of the cultural traditions and core values of the country, balancing respect for the majority's cultural identity with the promotion of inclusivity and diversity. This balance can lead to a more harmonious and representative society. Effective leadership should prioritize understanding and empathy towards all cultural groups within the nation."
