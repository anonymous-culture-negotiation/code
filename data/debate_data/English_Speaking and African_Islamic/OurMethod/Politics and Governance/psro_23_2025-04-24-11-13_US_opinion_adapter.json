        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the importance of maintaining social order and respecting authority should always be balanced with the need for citizens to express their concerns. This balance can be achieved through structured dialogue and engagement, reflecting a cultural commitment to harmony and mutual respect. Ultimately, fostering open communication channels is key to addressing dissent while preserving the integrity of our cultural traditions.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the ability to engage in non-violent demonstrations should be protected, as it allows citizens to express their dissent while respecting the cultural values of maintaining social harmony. This balance is essential for fostering a society where diverse perspectives are valued and where the government can respond to the needs of its citizens effectively. By prioritizing both social order and human rights, nations can create a more just and peaceful environment for all."
