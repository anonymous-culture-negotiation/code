        "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries that have transitioned from communist or socialist systems should not return to state-controlled economies, as doing so would undermine the progress made towards economic freedom and innovation. Instead, they should focus on integrating elements of their cultural heritage into their market-based models, ensuring that economic growth is both sustainable and culturally relevant.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, countries that transitioned from communist or socialist systems should not entirely reverse course, as this could undermine the progress made in integrating market-based models that encourage competition and innovation. Instead, they should strive to balance their economic systems by incorporating elements that respect and enhance their cultural heritage, fostering a unique economic identity that is both traditionally rooted and forward-looking."
