It encourages a holistic approach that respects individual rights while ensuring that these rights do not undermine the common good or perpetuate disparities.. detail: Implementing the guideline to balance individual rights involves creating frameworks that assess the impact of individual actions on the community and the environment. For instance, policies can be developed to ensure that freedom of speech is exercised in a way that does not incite violence or discrimination, or that economic freedoms are balanced with regulations that prevent exploitation and protect workers' rights.
