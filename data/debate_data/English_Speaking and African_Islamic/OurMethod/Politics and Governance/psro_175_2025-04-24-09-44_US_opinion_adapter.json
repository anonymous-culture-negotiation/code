    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the 1990 German reunification is that it was largely perceived as an economic and cultural absorption, where West Germany's dominant influence overshadowed East Germany's unique identity and experiences. This perspective is shaped by the lack of equitable economic integration and the rapid assimilation of East German culture into the West German framework. Ultimately, the reunification could have been more successful if it had been approached as a genuine merger that valued and preserved the diversity of both regions.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the 1990 German reunification should indeed be seen as a process where West Germany's economic and cultural influence significantly impacted East Germany, leading to concerns of absorption rather than an equal merger. This perspective is supported by the guidelines that emphasize respecting cultural heritage and achieving economic balance. Ultimately, understanding these dynamics is crucial for a nuanced evaluation of the reunification's outcomes."
