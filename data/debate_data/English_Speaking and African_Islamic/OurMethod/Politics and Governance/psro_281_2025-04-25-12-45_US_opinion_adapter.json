    "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, governments should prioritize transparency and accountability when considering limitations on civil liberties, ensuring that any actions taken are proportionate to the threats faced and do not erode the fundamental freedoms that citizens hold dear. This approach not only safeguards democratic values but also strengthens public trust in governmental institutions. By striking a careful balance, nations can maintain security without compromising their core identity.",
