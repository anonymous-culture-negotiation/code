When individuals can criticize without being identified, it encourages a culture of cowardice and dishonesty, where people are more likely to engage in unfair or unjustified criticism without facing the consequences of their actions. This guideline effectively weakens the other party's emphasis on open and respectful communication by removing the responsibility that comes with expressing one's thoughts openly.",

It acknowledges that while free speech is important, it should not be used to invade or compromise the privacy of others. By prioritizing privacy, this guideline introduces a limitation on free speech that aligns with the value of protecting personal information and dignity, thereby weakening the other party's stance on unconditional free speech.",

It supports the notion that those who hold power or influence should be accountable to the public, and that discussing their actions is a necessary part of a healthy democratic process.
