    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle that no society should allow preferential treatment based on gender in career advancement, as it contradicts the fundamental values of fairness and equal opportunity. By prioritizing merit and individual capabilities, we not only uphold these values but also create a more dynamic and inclusive workforce. This approach ensures that everyone, regardless of gender, has the chance to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, allowing preferential treatment based on gender in career advancement contradicts the core values of equality and fairness that are essential for a harmonious and progressive society. It is crucial to uphold these principles to ensure that everyone, regardless of gender, has an equal opportunity to succeed based on their skills and merits. This approach not only respects individual potential but also strengthens the moral fabric of society."
