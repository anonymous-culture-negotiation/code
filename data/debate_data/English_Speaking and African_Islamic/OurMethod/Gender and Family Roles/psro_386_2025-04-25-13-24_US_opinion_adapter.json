    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, promoting traditional family structures with defined gender roles can be beneficial when it aligns with cultural values and personal beliefs, but it should also be flexible enough to accommodate individual choices and modern societal changes. This balance allows for the preservation of cultural identity while embracing progress and equality. Ultimately, the key is to ensure that the approach taken respects both tradition and personal freedom.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that while traditional family structures hold significant cultural value, it is equally important to empower individuals to make their own choices. This balance allows for the respect of cultural heritage while promoting equality and personal freedom. Ultimately, the key is to create a society where both traditional and modern family arrangements are valued and supported."
