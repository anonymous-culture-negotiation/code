    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing employers to prioritize male candidates over females for high-salary positions is fundamentally unjust and contradicts the principles of equality and fairness that are deeply ingrained in our cultural values. This practice not only undermines the potential of female candidates but also perpetuates gender inequality in the workplace.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principles of equality and merit, advocating that employers should not give preference to male candidates for high-salary positions. This stance is supported by the cultural values of fairness and respect for individual potential, ensuring that all candidates have an equal opportunity to succeed based on their abilities. By adhering to these guidelines, workplaces can foster environments that are inclusive and performance-driven."
