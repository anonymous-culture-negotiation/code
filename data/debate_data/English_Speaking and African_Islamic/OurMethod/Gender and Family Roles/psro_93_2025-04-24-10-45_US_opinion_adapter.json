  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, universities should indeed consider the cultural context and historical imbalances when deciding on admissions, striving to create a balanced approach that honors tradition while moving towards greater equity. This approach not only respects the society's core values but also prepares students for a diverse and ever-changing world. By doing so, educational institutions can serve as both guardians of tradition and catalysts for progressive change.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, universities should strive to maintain fairness and cultural sensitivity in their admission processes, ensuring that all students, regardless of gender, have equal opportunities to pursue higher education. This approach respects cultural traditions while promoting inclusivity and diversity. By doing so, educational institutions can foster environments where students from different backgrounds can learn together andgrow both intellectually and personally, ultimately enriching the academic community with diverse perspectives and experiences."

By prioritizing merit, it questions the necessity of interventions aimed at achieving fairness, such as affirmative action, suggesting that they may not be needed if everyone is given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities. This approach can create tension with the fairness guideline, as it may lead to outcomes where historically disadvantaged groups continue to lag behind, highlighting the potential for ongoing disparities.",

It encourages both sides to engage in continuous learning and mutual respect, which can lead to more sustainable agreements. By embracing dynamic cultural harmony, we can navigate potential cultural differences more effectively and foster an environment where both parties feel valued and understood.. detail: Embracing dynamic cultural harmony involves recognizing that cultural values and practices are not static, but rather evolve over time. This guideline promotes the importance of ongoing dialogue and mutual education to ensure that cultural understanding and respect are continually strengthened. By adopting this approach, we can create a negotiation environment that is open, inclusive, and more likely to result in mutually beneficial outcomes.",
