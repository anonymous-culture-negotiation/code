        "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries should prioritize their cultural traditions and core values when addressing gender rights.

This can involve a gradual implementation of policies that educate and engage the community, ensuring that the changes are both meaningful and sustainable. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive society that honors its cultural identity while promoting equality for all."
