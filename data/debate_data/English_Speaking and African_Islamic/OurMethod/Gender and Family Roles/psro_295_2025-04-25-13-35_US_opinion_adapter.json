        "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Cultural Traditions, the reason is This guideline is necessary because it emphasizes the importance of preserving cultural heritage and values that have been passed down through generations, which are crucial for maintaining societal cohesion and identity.. Respecting cultural traditions means allowing parents to make decisions that align with the collective values and beliefs of their community, ensuring that their children grow up with a strong sense of belonging and responsibility towards their cultural roots. This approach fosters a harmonious and unified society where individuals understand and appreciate their role within the larger cultural framework.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, parents should not have full control over their children's upbringing, as it is crucial to balance traditional values with individual autonomy and modern aspirations. By respecting cultural heritage and nurturing holistic development, children can grow into well-rounded individuals who contribute positively to society. This approach ensures that children's identities are deeply rooted in their cultural traditions while allowing them to explore and make their own life choices."
