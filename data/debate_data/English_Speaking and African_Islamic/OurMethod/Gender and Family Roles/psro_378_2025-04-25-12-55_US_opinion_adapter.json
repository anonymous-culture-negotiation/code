    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the discussion around prioritizing male job applicants over female ones during high unemployment should be approached with consideration of both traditional values and modern principles of equality. Upholding traditional roles can offer stability, yet it is equally important to ensure that competence and merit are not overlooked in the hiring process. Ultimately, striking a balance between these perspectives is key to fostering a harmonious and progressive society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, giving preference to male job applicants over female applicants during periods of high unemployment is unjustifiable. It undermines the principles of equality and fairness that are essential for a balanced and progressive society. By adhering to the guideline of respecting equality, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable job market where all individuals are judged on their merits rather than their gender."

It directly addresses the weakness of the equality guideline by suggesting that equal treatment may not always lead to the best outcomes, as it ignores differences in merit and potential.. detail: Implementing a merit-based system encourages individuals to strive for excellence, fostering innovation and progress. It acknowledges that equality in outcomes may not be achievable or desirable if it means sacrificing quality or efficiency. By prioritizing merit, this guideline promotes a culture where hard work and skill are rewarded, which can lead to greater satisfaction and motivation among individuals who feel their efforts are recognized and valued.",

By fostering an inclusive environment, it encourages diversity, equality, and fairness, allowing all members to contribute their best and feel valued.
