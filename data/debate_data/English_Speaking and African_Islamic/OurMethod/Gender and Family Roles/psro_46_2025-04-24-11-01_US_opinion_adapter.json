    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the process of enacting laws to promote gender equality should be deeply rooted in cultural sensitivity and community engagement. It is essential to prioritize open dialogue and respect for traditional practices to ensurethat the implementation of such laws does not inadvertently alienate or marginalize certain groups, but rather fosters a cohesive and inclusive environment where all individuals can thrive.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the enactment of laws to promote gender equality should be approached with caution and respect for cultural traditions, ensuring that any legal measures are deeply rooted in the values and heritage of the community.
