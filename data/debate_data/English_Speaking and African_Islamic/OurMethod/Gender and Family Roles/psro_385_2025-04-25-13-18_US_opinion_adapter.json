    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, mandating educational institutions to support pregnant students is essential for fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect, allowing them to balance academic pursuits with their personal responsibilities. This approach not only benefits the individuals but also contributes to the broader societal goal of reducing educational disparities. By prioritizing the education of pregnant students, we uphold the values of compassion and equality that are central to our cultural identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "I strongly believe that educational institutions have a responsibility to accommodate and support pregnant students, as it not only upholds their right to education but also empowers them to make informed choices about their future. By providing adequate support, we can help break the cycle of disadvantage often faced by young mothers and promote a more equitable society. This approach is deeply rooted in the cultural values of empathy, community support, and the pursuit of knowledge for all."
