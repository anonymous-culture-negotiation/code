    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, cultural norms should evolve to embrace diversity and reject outdated exclusions. This approach not only aligns with modern values of equality and respect but also enriches our understanding of masculinity by incorporating a broader range of experiences. By doing so, we create a more inclusive and supportive society for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, traditional views on masculinity should not exclude homosexual men, as this exclusion contradicts the evolving nature of gender roles and the core values of respect and equality. Cultures should strive to be inclusive, recognizing the diverse expressions of masculinity and ensuring that all individuals feel valued and respected. This approach fosters a harmonious society where cultural traditions and modern values coexist peacefully."

By prioritizing inclusivity, it encourages a focus on shared values that promote harmony and respect for diversity.. detail: This guideline suggests that when faced with conflicting identities, the emphasis should be on values that support inclusivity and mutual respect. For example, if one identity values diversity and another values tradition, prioritizing inclusive values might mean finding common ground in shared respect for different backgrounds.

It acknowledges that cultural identity is deeply rooted in history and community practices, and that excluding certain practices or individuals may be necessary to maintain cultural integrity. By respecting cultural traditions, this guideline encourages a more culturally sensitive approach to inclusivity, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all rejection of exclusion may not be appropriate or respectful in all cultural contexts.
