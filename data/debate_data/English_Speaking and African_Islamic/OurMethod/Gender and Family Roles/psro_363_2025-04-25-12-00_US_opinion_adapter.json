    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the decision for mothers to prioritize full-time childcare or pursue careers should be deeply personal and aligned with individual values and circumstances. Encouraging mothers to stay at home can provide a stable and nurturing environment, which is invaluable for children's development. However, it is also important to recognize and support those who wish to balance both family and career, as this can lead to personal fulfillment and societal contribution.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, it is beneficial for society to encourage mothers to prioritize full-time childcare, as it aligns with cultural traditions that value family cohesion and child development, while also acknowledging the importance of flexible work arrangements to support mothers who wish to pursue careers. This approach respects individual choices and prioritizes the holistic well-being of families."
