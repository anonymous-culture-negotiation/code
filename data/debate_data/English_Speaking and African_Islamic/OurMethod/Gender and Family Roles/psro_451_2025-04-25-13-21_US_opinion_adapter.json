        "English_Speaking": "In my view, cultural expectations that discourage men from expressing emotions should be challenged to promote gender equality and emotional well-being. This approach aligns with the belief that emotions are a shared human experience and that preserving tradition does not have to mean stifling progress. By fostering an environment where all individuals can express their feelings openly, we can work towards a more equitable and compassionate society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, challenging emotional restraints is a step towards a more empathetic society, where men can express themselves freely, contributing to better mental health and relationships. By honoring cultural traditions, we ensure that our progress towards gender equality is rooted in respect and understanding of our cultural heritage. This balanced approach fosters a community that values both tradition and innovation."
