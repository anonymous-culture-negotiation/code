    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the selection of political leaders should be guided by a balance between respecting traditional gender roles and embracing equality, allowing for a harmonious blend of cultural heritage and progressive values. This approach ensures that leadership roles are filled by individuals who not only uphold cultural traditions but also contribute to societal advancement. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and balanced political landscape.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the suitability of political leaders should not be solely determined by traditional gender expectations, as this can limit the potential for diverse and effective leadership. Instead, a balance between respecting cultural norms and prioritizing merit is crucial for progress and harmony. This approach ensures that leaders are both culturally relatable and capable of driving positive change."
