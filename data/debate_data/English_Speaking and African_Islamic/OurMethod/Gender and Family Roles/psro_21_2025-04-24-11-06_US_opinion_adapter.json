    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that cultural sensitivity and awareness are crucial when evaluating gender practices in non-Western societies. It is essential to engage with each culture on its own terms, recognizing the diversity of human experiences and the validity of different cultural expressions. This approach fosters greater understanding and cooperation, allowing for meaningful dialogue and mutual respect.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that while gender equality and respect are universal ideals, their implementation should be culturally sensitive and contextually appropriate, allowing non-Western societies to evolve based on their own values and traditions. This approach respects cultural diversity and promotes genuine understanding and cooperation. It also acknowledges that Western concepts, while valuable, may not be universally applicable."
