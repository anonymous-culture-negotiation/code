        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural traditions and family values should be prioritized. Upholding these principles not only ensures the preservation of our cultural identity but also fosters a harmonious and cohesive society. By respecting and honoring these guidelines, we can create an environment where women's roles are defined by their cultural significance and contribution to the family.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, while cultural norms should be respected, there should also be a respectful dialogue about evolving roles that allow women to contribute to the workforce if they choose to, ensuring their rights and opportunities are not limited by traditional expectations. This balance respects cultural identity while promoting equality and empowerment."
