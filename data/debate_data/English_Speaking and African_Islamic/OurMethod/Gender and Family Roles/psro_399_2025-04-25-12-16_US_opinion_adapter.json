        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is deeply rooted in the belief that cultural traditions should be respected while also allowing for gradual progress towards gender equality. This balance is essential to avoid cultural backlash and ensure that changes are meaningful and lasting. Ultimately, it is about creating a harmonious blend of heritage and modern values.",
