    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the traditional family structure should be respected while also allowing for women to have the freedom to pursue careers if they choose to, as long as it does not disrupt the harmony of the family. This balance is essential for maintaining cultural integrity and supporting the evolving needs of modern families. Ultimately, the key is to find a harmonious blend that honors tradition while embracing progress.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, women should not be discouraged from pursuing careers outside the home, as long as their professional aspirations are balanced with respect for cultural heritage and family harmony. This balance allows women to contribute positively to society while maintaining the integrity of their cultural identity. By empowering women, we foster a more inclusive and progressive society that values both tradition and personal growth."
