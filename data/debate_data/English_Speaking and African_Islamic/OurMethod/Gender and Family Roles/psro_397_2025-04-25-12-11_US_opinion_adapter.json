    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the balance between cultural traditions and personal freedoms is crucial, as it allows societies to evolve while maintaining their heritage. This approach respects the historical context of arranged marriages while acknowledging the importance of women's autonomy. Ultimately, it fosters a harmonious blend of tradition and progress.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, while cultural traditions are vital, they should not override a woman's right to choose her own partner. Balancing respect for tradition with individual autonomy is crucial, ensuring that women's rights are protected while honoring the cultural heritage. This balance allows for the evolution of traditions in a way that respects both collective identity and personal freedom."
