    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on arranged marriages is that they should be approached with sensitivity and understanding of cultural traditions. While respecting the family's role, it's important to ensure that the individual's autonomy and happiness are also considered. This balance can lead to more fulfilling and meaningful relationships.",

This approach respects the diversity of cultural practices while safeguarding the rights and happiness of the individuals involved. By embracing this perspectivewe can foster a more inclusive environment where cultural heritage and personal autonomy coexist, ensuring that the rich traditions of our ancestors continue to thrive while adapting to the evolving needs of contemporary life."
