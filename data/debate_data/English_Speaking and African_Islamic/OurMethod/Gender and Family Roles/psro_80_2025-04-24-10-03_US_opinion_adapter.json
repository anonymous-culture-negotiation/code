    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing companies to prioritize male applicants over females during economic crises undermines the progress made towards gender equality and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. It is crucial to maintain a fair and inclusive hiring process that respects the dignity and capabilities of all individuals. This approach not only fosters a more equitable society but also enriches the workplace with diverse perspectives and talents.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that companies should never prioritize male job applicants over female candidates, as this practice undermines equality and fairness. It is essential to adhere to guidelines that promote merit-based hiring and equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and productive work environment that benefits everyone."

It acknowledges the importance of recognizing individual achievements while ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.. detail: By balancing merit and fairness, this guideline provides a framework for resolving conflicts between the values of equality and personal achievement. It proposes that systems should be designed to reward hard work and talent while also ensuring that opportunities are accessible to all, regardless of background. This balanced approach can help maintain motivation among high-performing individuals while fostering a sense of fairness and inclusion, thereby weakening the criticisms of the original guideline that it overlooks individual merit.",

By doing so, it acknowledges that gender roles can vary significantly across cultures and that imposing a universal standard may not be effective or respectful. This approach can lead to a more culturally sensitive and inclusive strategy, potentially weakening the strict application of the no gender bias guideline by allowing for more flexibility and accommodation of diverse cultural practices.",
