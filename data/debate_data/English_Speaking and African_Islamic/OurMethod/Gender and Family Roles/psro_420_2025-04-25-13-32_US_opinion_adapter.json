  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, respecting cultural traditions while promoting gender equality is crucial in addressing the preference for male children. This approach allows for a gradual shift in societal values that aligns with both the preservation of heritage and the advancement of equality. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and balanced society thatvalues the contributions of all individuals, regardless of gender, and fosters an environment where cultural identity and progressive ideals coexist harmoniously.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the preference for male children in cultures that value patrilineal inheritance and male-dominated family structures is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach. It is crucial to respect cultural values while promoting equality and educating communities about the importance of gender balance. By fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of both cultural heritage and universal human rights, we can work towards a more equitable society where every individual's value is recognized."
