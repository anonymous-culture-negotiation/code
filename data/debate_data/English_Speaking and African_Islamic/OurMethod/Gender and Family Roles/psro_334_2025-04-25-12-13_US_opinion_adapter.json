It addresses the other party's weaknesses by highlighting the importance of flexibility in achieving true equality, which can often be overlooked in static, traditional frameworks. By emphasizing dynamism, it encourages a more nuanced understanding of equality that can better accommodate diverse needs and contexts.. detail: The concept of Dynamic Equality proposes that equality should not be seen as a fixed state but rather as a continuous process of adjustment and adaptation. It recognizes that different individuals and groups may require different approaches to achieve equal opportunities and treatment. This perspective encourages open dialogue and collaboration to identify and address the unique barriers faced by various groups, thereby fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.
