For example, a community might have the autonomy to manage its local resources, but this should be done in a way that does not lead to environmental degradation or violate human rights. By incorporating oversight, this guideline aims to address the potential for local decisions to negatively impact larger populations or ecosystems, thus strengthening the resilience and fairness of the autonomy being granted.",

It ensures that all stakeholders understand the limits and scope of autonomy, facilitating more effective and consistent decision-making that respects both local preferences and broader societal values.",
        "English_Speaking_response": "We propose the guideline of Balance Autonomy with Oversight, which ensures that local autonomy is exercised in a way that respects broader societal interests and universal principles.
