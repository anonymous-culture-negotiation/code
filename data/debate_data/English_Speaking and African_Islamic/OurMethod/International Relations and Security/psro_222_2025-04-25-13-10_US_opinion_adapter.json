        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle of prioritizing national sovereignty and cultural integrity when considering the establishment of foreign military bases. This perspective is rooted in the belief that a nation's identity and autonomy are non-negotiable. By adhering to these guidelines, a country can safeguard its values and maintain its unique cultural heritage.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that nations should approach the establishment of foreign military bases with caution, prioritizing their sovereignty and cultural identity while considering the potential security benefits that such bases could offer. This balanced approach allows for a nuanced discussion that respects both national interests and global responsibilities. Ultimately, the decision should be made with careful consideration of the long-term implications for the nation's autonomy and cultural heritage."
