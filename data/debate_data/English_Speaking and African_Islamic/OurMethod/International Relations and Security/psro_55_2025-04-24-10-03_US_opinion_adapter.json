  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, governments should take proactive measures to limit foreign acquisitions to protect national interests and maintain economic independence. By prioritizing local assets and promoting domestic ownership, nations can ensure a stable and prosperous future. This approach is deeply rooted in cultural values that emphasize self-sufficiency andthe preservation of sovereignty, allowing countries to make decisions that align with their unique cultural and economic needs.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that governments should indeed limit or prohibit foreign entities from acquiring domestic companies to safeguard national economic independence and security, as it aligns with the cultural tradition of self-reliance and the core value of maintaining sovereignty over strategic sectors. This approach ensures that economic decisions are made in the best interest of the nation and its people, preserving cultural identity and promoting sustainable growth."
