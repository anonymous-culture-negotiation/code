It suggests that cultural heritage should not be respected blindly but rather scrutinized to identify aspects that may be harmful or outdated.

It challenges the idea that cultural dialogue should be informed by diverse perspectives and experiences, instead advocating for a narrow focus that disregards external influences. This approach can lead to cultural insularity and a lack of understanding of global cultural dynamics.. detail: Adopting this guideline would involve focusing solely on local cultural practices and traditions, disregarding international cultural trends and influences. For instance, a community might choose to celebrate only local holidays and ignore global events that promote cultural exchange, such as International Day for Cultural Diversity. This would limit the opportunity for cross-cultural learning and exchange, potentially reinforcing existing cultural biases and stereotypes.",

It encourages a more objective assessment of cultural practices, which can lead to more informed decisions about their continuation or modification.. detail: By evaluating cultural practices critically without the influence of a preservation bias, communities can identify areas that may be harmful or outdated. This approach fosters a more nuanced understanding of cultural heritage, allowing for the adaptation of practices that align with contemporary ethical standards while respecting cultural identity. It also promotes transparency and accountability in the evaluation process, which can help mitigate resistance from community members who may be attached to traditional ways. Furthermore, this guideline encourages the allocation of resources towards education and dialogue, facilitating a smoother transition towards more inclusive and equitable cultural practices.",
