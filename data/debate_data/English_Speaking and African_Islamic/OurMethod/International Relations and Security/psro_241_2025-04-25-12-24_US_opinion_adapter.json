  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this matter is that Japan should indeed issue additional formal apologies for its wartime actions, as it aligns with the values of accountability and respect. By honoring the past and respecting sovereignty, Japan can work towards genuine reconciliation and strengthen its relationships with neighboring countries. This approach not only reflects a commitment to ethical conduct but also fosters a more...harmonious and cooperative international environment, where historical grievances are acknowledged and addressed, allowing for mutual understanding and progress.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that Japan should approach the issue with sensitivity, ensuring that any formal apologies are deeply rooted in cultural traditions and values, while also acknowledging the harm caused to neighboring countries. This balanced approach can help in fostering reconciliation and maintaining the integrity of historical narratives. By respecting cultural heritage and acknowledging past harm, Japan can work towards a more harmonious relationship with its neighbors."

This could lead to the perpetuation of ineffective or discriminatory practices, as there would be no mechanism for questioning or challenging the status quo.
