    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, permitting economic investments from geopolitical rivals poses significant risks to national sovereignty and cultural integrity, as it can lead to undue influence and potential manipulation by foreign entities. Upholding these guidelines is crucial to safeguarding our nation's autonomy and ensuring that economic growth occurs without compromising our core values. By prioritizing national sovereignty and cultural integrity, we can navigate complex geopolitical landscapes while maintaining our unique identity and interests.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, allowing economic investments from geopolitical rivals should be approached with caution, ensuring that such investments do not undermine national sovereignty or security. The focus should be on fostering economic growth that aligns with the country's cultural and ethical standards. By doing so, nations can navigate the complexities of international trade while preserving their core values and autonomy."
