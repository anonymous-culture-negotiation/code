        "English_Speaking": "In my view, allowing countries to conduct military interventions for resource control undermines the principles of international law and ethics. It is crucial to prioritize diplomacy and respect for sovereignty to ensure that global interactions are guided by fairness and mutual respect.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that countries should not be allowed to conduct military interventions for resource security, as it undermines global peace and the principles of sovereignty and self-determination. The pursuit of resources should be addressed through diplomatic means and international cooperation, ensuring that all nations benefit equitably. This approach aligns with the cultural value of respecting other nations' autonomy and fostering a harmonious global community."
