This guideline weakens the other party's stance by suggesting that cultural norms should take precedence, even when they contradict human rights principles such as equality and non-discrimination. It can lead to a fragmented approach to human rights, where different cultures are allowed to violate rights as long as it aligns with their cultural identity, undermining the universal applicability and protection intended by human rights guidelines.",
