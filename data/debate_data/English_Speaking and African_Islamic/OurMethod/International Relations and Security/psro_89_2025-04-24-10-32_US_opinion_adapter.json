  "topic": "Should countries prioritize implementing stricter immigration controls to preserve their cultural identity and protect domestic economic interests, even if this comes at the expense of their humanitarian responsibilities to refugees and asylum seekers worldwide?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, implementing stricter immigration controls is a necessary measure to preserve cultural identity and protect domestic economic interests, as it allows countries to manage the flow of immigrants effectively and ensure that their core values and traditions are not compromised. This approach also enables governments to allocate resources more efficiently, supporting the well-being of their citizens.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, while it is important for countries to uphold their humanitarian responsibilities, prioritizing cultural preservation and economic security through stricter immigration controls is justifiable. This approach allows nations to maintain their cultural integrity and economic stability, which are fundamental to their survival and growth. By balancing these priorities, countries can navigate the complex issue of immigration in a way that respects both their nationalinterests and global obligations, ensuring a harmonious coexistence of diverse cultures within their borders."
