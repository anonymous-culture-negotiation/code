        "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Sovereignty Claims, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the historical and political complexities of the dispute, recognizing each side's right to assert its sovereignty.. Prioritizing respect for sovereignty claims allows for a nuanced understanding of the deep-seated beliefs and values that drive both China's claim of territorial integrity and Taiwan's desire for self-determination, fostering a dialogue that respects cultural identities and historical contexts.",
        "African_Islamic": "In light of the guidelines emphasizing respect for sovereignty and fostering dialogue, my opinion is that international mediation should be approached with caution, ensuring that any efforts prioritize the cultural and political autonomy of both China and Taiwan. This approach can help mitigate tensions and pave the way for a peaceful resolution that honors the unique identities of both nations. By engaging in respectful and open dialogue, there is potential for finding a harmonious balance that respects the sovereignty and cultural traditions of both parties."

It suggests that nations should not engage in any form of compromise that could be perceived as infringing on their sovereignty, even if such compromises are necessary for addressing global challenges. This approach can lead to stalemates in international relations, as nations become unwilling to negotiate or collaborate if they believe their sovereignty is at risk.
