  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My perspective on this issue is deeply rooted in the belief that the United States should prioritize both respect for sovereignty and the protectionof its citizens, which can sometimes create a delicate balance in foreign policy decisions, especially when dealing with nations that have differing values and practices.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the United States should not conduct drone strikes in Pakistan without their explicit consent, as it violates Pakistani sovereignty and risks civilian lives. It is crucial to engage in diplomaticefforts to build trust and cooperation with the Pakistani government, ensuring that any counter-terrorism measures are mutually agreed upon and respect the country's autonomy, thereby fostering a more collaborative and effective approach to regional security."
