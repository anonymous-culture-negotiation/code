  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries should indeed focus on solving their internal problems before allocating resources to foreign aid, as this approach not only strengthens their own foundations but also enhances their credibility and influence on the global stage. By prioritizing internal stability and respecting sovereignty, nations can contribute more effectively to international development and humanitarian efforts. This balanced approach aligns with the values of responsibility andself-sufficiency, ultimately fostering a more harmonious and interconnected world where each nation can proudly uphold its unique identity while contributing to the greater good.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, countries should indeed prioritize solving their internal affairs to create a stable foundation for providing foreign aid, ensuring that their assistance is both culturally sensitive and sustainable. This approach respects the cultural traditions of both the giving and receiving nations, fostering stronger global partnerships. By focusing on domestic issues first, a country can offer more impactful support to other nations, aligning with their core values and promoting mutual respect and understanding."
