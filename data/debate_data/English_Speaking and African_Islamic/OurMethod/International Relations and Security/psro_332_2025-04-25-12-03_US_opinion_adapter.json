        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the 2011 operation that led to Osama bin Laden's death raises complex ethical questions about the balance between justice and human rights. While it may have been seen as a necessary act to prevent future harm, it is essential to critically evaluate whether it adhered to international ethical standards. Ultimately, the operation's justification hinges on whether it respected human rights and followed just war principles, reflecting broader cultural values of fairness and accountability.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the principles of respecting human rights and ensuring that justice is served rather than revenge. The operation's ethical justifiability hinges on whether it adhered to these principles, considering the global context and the implications for international relations and human dignity."

This guideline can significantly limit the scope of human rights initiatives, as it prioritizes adherence to local legislation over universal rights.
