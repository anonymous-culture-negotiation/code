        "English_Speaking": "In my view, limiting foreign investment is a prudent strategy that aligns with the cultural value of self-reliance and the importance of maintaining control over our economic destiny. This approach not only safeguards our national interests but also promotes a sense of pride and resilience within the community. By prioritizing domestic businesses and innovation, we can ensure a prosperous future that reflects our unique cultural identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, countries should indeed limit foreign investment in domestic businesses to protect their economic independence and national security interests, as this ensures that strategic sectors remain under national control and align with cultural values. By implementing guidelines such as protecting national assets and encouraging balanced investment, nations can navigate the complexities of foreign investment while preserving their sovereignty. This balanced approach supports economic growth while safeguarding cultural traditions and core values."

This approach can weaken the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by introducing a principle that may override the pursuit of cultural exchange and global collaboration when they are perceived to threaten national sovereignty.. detail: Implementing this guideline involves ensuring that all cultural exchange programs and global collaborations are carefully vetted to align with national interests and security. It requires establishing clear criteria for what constitutes a threat to national sovereignty and developing strategies to mitigate such risks while still engaging in cultural exchange.
