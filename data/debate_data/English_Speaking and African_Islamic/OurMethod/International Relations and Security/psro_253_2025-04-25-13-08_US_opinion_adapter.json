    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "we insist Prioritize National Sovereignty, the reason is This guideline is essential because it respects the unique cultural and historical context of each EU member state, allowing them to tailor their responses to refugees and asylum seekers according to their individual capabilities and societal values.. Emphasizing national sovereignty in policy-making ensures that each country can maintain its distinct identity and address local concerns without being mandated by a centralized authority, which can sometimes be disconnected from the specific needs of its citizens. This approach fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among member states, enabling more effective and tailored solutions to the complex issues surrounding refugee integration and asylum processes.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the European Union should strive to find a balance that respects the cultural heritage and autonomy of its member countries while fulfilling its collective humanitarian responsibilities towards refugees and asylum seekers. This approach allows for diverse cultural expressions to coexist with a unified commitment to human rights and dignity. By doing so, the EU can create policies that are both culturally sensitive and effectively address the needs of those seeking refuge."
