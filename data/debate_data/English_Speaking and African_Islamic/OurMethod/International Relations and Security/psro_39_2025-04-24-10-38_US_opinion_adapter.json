  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this matter is deeply rooted in the belief that while national security is paramount, it should not come at the cost of stifling academic progress and cultural enrichment. The United States should strive to find a balance that allows for the continuation of its academic leadership while safeguarding its interests. This approach not only reflects the country'svalues of openness and innovation but also ensures that it remains a beacon for global talent, fostering an environment where knowledge and ideas can flourish without undue restriction.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that while national security concerns are legitimate, they should not overshadow the importance of cultural exchange and academic collaboration. It is crucial to find a balance that respects both the need for security and the value of international exchange. By implementing careful screening and collaboration agreements, the United States can protect its interests while continuing to benefit from the diverse perspectives and knowledge that international students bring."
