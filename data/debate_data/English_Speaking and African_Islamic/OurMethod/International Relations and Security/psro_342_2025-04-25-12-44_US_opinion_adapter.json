It effectively undermines the other party's guidelines by prioritizing national interests over global ethical considerations, which can lead to a disregard for human rights violations justified by national security or cultural preservation.. detail: By emphasizing sovereignty, this guideline creates a scenario where national decisions are paramount, and external pressures to adhere to human rights standards are minimized. This approach can result in a lack of accountability for human rights abuses, as the primary focus shifts to maintaining national autonomy and interests. The practical implication is that countries may feel justified in ignoring international criticism regarding human rights, as long as they are acting in what they perceive as their national interest.",
