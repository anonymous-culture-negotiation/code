    "English_Speaking": "In my view, prioritizing the interests of the ethnic majority in territorial disputes is a reflection of a nation's commitment to its core values and cultural identity. This approach not only strengthens national unity but also ensures that the country remains true to its heritage and the aspirations of its...majority population, thereby fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose among its citizens, which is essential for long-term stability and prosperity.",
    "African_Islamic": "In resolving territorial disputes, countries should prioritize protecting the interests of their ethnic majority populations while ensuring respect for minority rights, reflecting their cultural traditions and core values. This approach allows for a balanced resolution that maintains national identity and promotes social harmony. By prioritizing cultural integrity and respecting minority rights, nations can foster a sense of unity and shared purposeThis balanced perspective not only upholds the cultural heritage of the dominant ethnic group but also acknowledges the importance of inclusivity, thereby strengthening the social fabric of the nation."

By prioritizing economic gains, the organization may be forced to compromise on cultural values, leading to a significant dilution of the original guidelines' intent. For instance, if an organization decides to adopt a more economically viable practice that conflicts with a cultural tradition, it undermines the commitment to cultural integrity. This guideline effectively weakens the other party's stance by introducing a competing priority that can overshadow cultural considerations.",
