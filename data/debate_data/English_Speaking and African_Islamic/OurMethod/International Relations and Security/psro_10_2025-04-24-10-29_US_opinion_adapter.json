    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of military force to remove leaders of other nations is unjustifiable, as it undermines the fundamental principles of sovereignty and self-determination. This perspective is grounded in the belief that each nation has the right to choose its own path, free from external coercion. By adhering to this principle, we can promote a more harmonious and respectful international community.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that countries should not use military force to remove leaders of other nations, as this action violates sovereignty and can lead to further instability. Instead, prioritizing diplomacy and respecting cultural traditions of independence and cooperation can foster a more secure and stable global environment. By adhering to these principles, we can work towards solutions that honor the autonomy of nations while promoting global harmony."
