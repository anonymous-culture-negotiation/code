        "English_Speaking": "In my view, nations should prioritize cultural preservation and alignment when addressing refugee crises, as these principles safeguard the nation's identity and promote social cohesion. This approach allows for a balanced consideration of humanitarian needs while ensuring that the cultural fabric of the nation remains intact. By doing so, the nation can maintain its unique character and continue to thrive as a cohesive entity.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion strongly supports the idea of nations prioritizing their cultural integrity when dealing with refugee crises, as it is crucial for maintaining social harmony and preserving the unique cultural heritage of each nation. This approach does not negate the importance of humanitarian efforts but emphasizes the need for balanced and thoughtful immigration policies that respect both the rights of refugees and the cultural values of the host nation."
