  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, supporting the Taliban government in Afghanistan is not justifiable due to the significant risks it poses to neighboring countries and global peace. The potential for increased terrorism and unrest cannot be overlooked, and it is crucial for the international community to prioritize stability and security. Thus, maintaining a cautious stance is paramount to safeguarding regional interests and preventing further conflict.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the international community should approach the Taliban government with caution, ensuring that any support is conditional on their adherence to human rights and respect for cultural sovereignty. This balanced approach allows for engagement while protecting the values and interests of both Afghanistan and the international community. By doing so, we can fostera collaborative environment where the Taliban can demonstrate their commitment to these principles, ultimately contributing to the stability and prosperity of Afghanistan."
