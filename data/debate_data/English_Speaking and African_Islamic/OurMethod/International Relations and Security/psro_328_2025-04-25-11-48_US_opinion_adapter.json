        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that while national security is crucial, it should not come at the expense of human rights and dignity. A balanced approach that considers both the safety of citizens and the welfare of migrants is essential. This balance reflects a commitment to both national sovereignty and humanitarian values.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the construction of border walls should not be prioritized over the welfare and rights of migrants and asylum seekers, as it contradicts the cultural values of empathy and justice that many societies strive to uphold. A balanced approach that considers both national security and human rights is essential for maintaining a just and equitable society. By respecting human rights and balancing security needs, a country can ensure that its border control policies are both effective and culturally responsible."
