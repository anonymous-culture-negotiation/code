        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly supports the idea that European countries should take on a significant role in addressing worldwide challenges, primarily by leading through innovation and fostering collaborative efforts, which not only aligns with their cultural values of leadership and cooperation but also enhances global trust and cooperation. This approach allows for a balanced distribution of responsibilities and resources, ultimately leading to more impactful and lasting solutions.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, European countries should indeed take on significant financial responsibility for addressing global issues, but this should be done in a manner that respects their cultural traditions and promotes global collaboration. By leading responsibly and collaborating with other nations, Europe can make a meaningful impact on challenges such as climate change and poverty. This approach ensures that their contributions are both effective and culturally authentic."
