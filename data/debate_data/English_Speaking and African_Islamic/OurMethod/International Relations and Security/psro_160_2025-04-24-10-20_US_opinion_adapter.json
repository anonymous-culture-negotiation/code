    "English_Speaking": "we insist Protect Cultural Integrity, the reason is This guideline is essential because it allows the European Union to safeguard its unique cultural heritage from potential erosion by American influences.. Protecting cultural integrity involves implementing policies that ensure American multinational companies respect and adhere to European values and traditions, fostering a diverse and enriched cultural landscape within the EU. This approach not only preserves historical identities but also promotes cultural exchange that is mutually beneficial and respectful.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, imposing limitations on American multinational companies is a necessary step to preserve the cultural uniqueness and economic autonomy of the European Union. By doing so, the EU can ensure that its cultural traditions and core values remain vibrant and influential, while also fostering a strong and independent economy. This approach allows for a harmonious balance between global engagementand local preservation, enabling the EU to navigate the complexities of globalization while maintaining its distinct identity and sovereignty."
