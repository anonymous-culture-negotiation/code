This could lead to the demolition of historical sites for new developments or the commercialization of cultural practices, undermining the efforts to safeguard cultural integrity. The emphasis on economic growth may also result in the marginalization of minority cultures whose practices are not seen as economically beneficial, further weakening the other party's guidelines that aim to inclusively preserve cultural heritage.",
