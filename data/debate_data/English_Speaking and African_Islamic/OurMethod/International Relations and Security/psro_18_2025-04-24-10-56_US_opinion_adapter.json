    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the threat posed by violent ideologies inspired by radical interpretations of Islam is often exaggerated and misunderstood. These ideologies do not reflect the true essence of Islam but rather a distorted version that seeks to divide rather than unite. By focusing on the principles of respect, understanding, and inclusivity, we can work towards a more harmonious and secure society.",
