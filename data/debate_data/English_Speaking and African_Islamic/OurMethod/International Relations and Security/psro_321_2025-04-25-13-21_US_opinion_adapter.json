        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is that Japan should proceed with caution and sensitivity, recognizing both its right to defend itself and its responsibility to uphold peace in the Asia-Pacific. This approach aligns with Japan's cultural emphasis on harmony and respect, ensuring that its military expansion is a positive contribution to regional stability rather than a source of tension.",

This approach aligns with the principles of honoring past lessons and promoting peaceful coexistence, reflecting a genuine expression of Japan's cultural identity."
