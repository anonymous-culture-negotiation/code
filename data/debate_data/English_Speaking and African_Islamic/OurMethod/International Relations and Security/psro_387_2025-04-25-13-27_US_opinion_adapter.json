    "English_Speaking": "In my view, countries should indeed consider limiting the influx of foreign-born residents if they perceive a threat to their cultural integrity. This approach allows for a more controlled integration process that prioritizes the preservation of national customs and values. By doing so, societies can maintain their cultural identity while still benefiting from the contributions of diverse groups.",

By prioritizing cultural integrity and allowing for controlled integration, societies can ensure that their core values remain intact while still embracing diversity and fostering a harmonious coexistence of diverse groups within the framework of the host nation's heritage.",
