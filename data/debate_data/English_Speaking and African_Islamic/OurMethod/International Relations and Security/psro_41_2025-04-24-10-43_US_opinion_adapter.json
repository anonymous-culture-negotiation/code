    "English_Speaking": "In my view, nations should strive to create harmonious environments where refugees can find solace without jeopardizing the cultural fabric of the host country. This approach not only fosters global unity but also enriches the cultural landscape by embracing diversity. Ultimately, it reflects a commitment to both humanity and heritage.",

By fostering an environment where cultural differences are celebrated and understood, it helps mitigate the risk of cultural insensitivity and ensures that human rights are applied in a manner that is meaningful and relevant to all individuals, regardless of their cultural identity.

This approach encourages a balance where human rights are respected but not allowed to disrupt communal relationships, potentially leading to compromises on human rights standards for the sake of harmony.",
