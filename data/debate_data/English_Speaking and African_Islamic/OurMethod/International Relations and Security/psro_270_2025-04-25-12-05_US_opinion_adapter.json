By ignoring humanitarian crises abroad, this guideline ensures that the principle of respecting sovereignty is upheld without any consideration for the well-being of individuals beyond national borders. This approach is feasible because it aligns with a strict interpretation of non-interference, a principle often cited in international relations.
