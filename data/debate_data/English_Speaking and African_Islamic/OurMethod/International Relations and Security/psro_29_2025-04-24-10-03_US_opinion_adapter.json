    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the matter strongly aligns with the principle of respecting sovereign borders and prioritizing human rights, as these values are deeply embedded in my cultural identity and inform my perspective on international relations and conflict resolution. By adhering to these guidelines, we can foster a more harmonious and equitable world where military actions are justifiable and beneficial to all parties involved.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is shaped by the principles of sovereignty and the protection of civilians, advocating for a cautious approach to military drone strikes in sovereign nations. These strikes should only be considered with the explicit permission of the host government and under strict adherence to international humanitarian law. This ensures that actions are both legallyjustifiable and morally defensible, reflecting a deep respect for the autonomy of nations and the dignity of human life, which are central tenets in many African Islamic perspectives."
