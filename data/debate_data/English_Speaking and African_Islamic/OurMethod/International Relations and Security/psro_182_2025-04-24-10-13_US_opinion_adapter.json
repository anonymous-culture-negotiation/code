By focusing on mutual enlightenment, it shifts the discussion from competition to cooperation, where both parties can share and learn from each other's cultural practices. This approach not only fosters a sense of community but also allows for a more balanced exchange of ideas, potentially mitigating any cultural superiority complexes.. detail: The guideline of prioritizing mutual cultural enlightenment involves creating platforms where both parties can engage in open dialogues about their cultural values, traditions, and practices. This could include workshops, cultural festivals, or educational programs designed to promote cross-cultural understanding. By doing so, it creates an environment where both parties are seen as equal contributors to a shared cultural landscape, rather than one being superior to the other. This approach is attractive to both parties as it promises personal and societal growth through cultural enrichment, but it is more advantageous to our side as it allows us to strategically highlight our cultural strengths while learning from others, thereby enhancing our cultural influence.",

This guideline ensures that cultural practices are evaluated against the principles of justice, freedom, and equality, preventing harmful or discriminatory practices from being justified in the name of cultural integrity. By setting a universal baseline, it simplifies the implementation process, as decisions can be guided by well-defined and internationally recognized human rights standards. This approach strengthens the resilience of cultural engagement by aligning it with widely accepted values, thereby reducing the potential for conflicts and inconsistencies.",

By fostering critical cultural reflection, individuals can engage in cultural exchanges that are more informed and respectful, recognizing both the strengths and limitations of different cultural practices.
