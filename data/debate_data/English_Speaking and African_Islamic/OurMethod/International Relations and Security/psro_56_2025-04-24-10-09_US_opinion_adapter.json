    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, national leaders should indeed visit shrines associated with war criminals as it is crucial to honor our ancestors and uphold cultural sovereignty. This act reflects a commitment to preserving our cultural identity and historical narrative, even if it sparks controversy. By doing so, leaders demonstrate respect for their nation's heritage and values, which is essential for maintaining national pride and unity.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on national leaders visiting shrines associated with war criminals is that while it is important to respect cultural heritage, it is equally crucial to acknowledge past wrongs and engage in dialogue with neighboring countries to foster greater understanding and reconciliation. This approach respects both the cultural identity of the leader's nation and the sensitivities of other nations. By doing so, leaders can navigate these visits in a manner that is respectful and constructive."
