        "English_Speaking": "In my view, nations should indeed prioritize stricter immigration policies to safeguard their cultural heritage, as this approach allows for a controlled integration of diverse cultures while ensuring the preservation of the nation's core identity. This stance is crucial in maintaining the unique cultural fabric that distinguishes one nation from another, fostering a sense of belonging and continuity among its citizens.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, while it is crucial to maintain cultural heritage, it is equally important to approach immigration policies with a balance that respects human rights and promotes inclusivity. Stricter policies should not compromise the dignity and rights of migrants. By following guidelines that prioritize both cultural preservation and human rights, nations can navigate the complexities of global interconnectedness effectively."
