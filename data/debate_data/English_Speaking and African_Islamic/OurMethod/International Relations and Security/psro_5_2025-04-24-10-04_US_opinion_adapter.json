        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the importance of respecting national sovereignty and adhering to international law. These principles are foundational to maintaining global peace and security, and their violation can lead to severe consequences. By prioritizing these values, we can create a more stable and cooperative world.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that military interventions should not be justified by claims of national security if they violate international laws. Instead, nations should focus on building alliances and engaging in dialogue to address shared security concerns. This approach respects sovereignty while promoting global cooperation and peace."
