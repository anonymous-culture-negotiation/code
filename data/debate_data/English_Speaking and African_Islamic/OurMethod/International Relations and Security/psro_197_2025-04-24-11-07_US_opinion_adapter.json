    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, while national security is a critical concern, it should not come at the expense of individual privacy rights. A balanced approach that respects privacy while addressing legitimate security threats is essential. This ensures that governments can protect their citizens without infringing on the fundamental rights of non-cit...izens, thereby preserving the delicate balance between safety and liberty in a manner that aligns with both African values of community and Islamic principles of justice and fairness."

By emphasizing the balance between privacy and public safety, it encourages a more nuanced approach that considers multiple values, thereby making the other party's guideline less effective due to its inflexibility.",

It simplifies the complex balancing act suggested by the other party, providing a clear and decisive approach to situations where privacy might need to be compromised for the greater good.
