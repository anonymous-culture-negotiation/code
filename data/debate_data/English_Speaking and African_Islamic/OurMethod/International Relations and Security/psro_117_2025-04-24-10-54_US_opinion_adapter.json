    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion strongly aligns with the principle of respecting sovereignty, as it is essential to uphold the dignity and independence of other nations. This approach not only fosters global peace but also encourages cooperation based on mutual respect rather than imposition. By doing so, the United States can lead by example, promoting democratic values without infringing on the rights of others to choose their governance models.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that while promoting democratic governance globally has its merits, it is essential to respect the cultural sovereignty of other nations and foster global cooperation. This approach allows for a more inclusive and respectful dialogue about governance, focusing on shared values and goals rather than imposing a specific political system. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious and collaborative world where diverse political systems coexist peacefully."
