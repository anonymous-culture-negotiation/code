    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My perspective on this issue is deeply rooted in the belief that the United States has a moral obligation to address the consequences of its actions, particularly in terms of drug demand and arms trafficking, which significantly contribute to the violence in Mexico. By taking responsibility, the U.S. can lead efforts to dismantle these criminal networks and support Mexico in strengthening its institutions and security measures. This approach aligns with the American values of accountability and leadership, ensuring a more equitable and secure future for both nations.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the United States should not bear the sole responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico, as this issue is deeply intertwined with both countries' policies and cultural dynamics. A balanced approach that respects Mexico's sovereignty and encourages shared responsibility is crucial for effective and sustainable solutions."
