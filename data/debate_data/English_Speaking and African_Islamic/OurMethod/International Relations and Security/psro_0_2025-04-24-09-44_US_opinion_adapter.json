        "English_Speaking": "My opinion is that while military force can be a crucial tool in combating terrorism, it should be used judiciously and in conjunction with diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of extremism. This balanced approach respects both the need for security and the importance of fostering international cooperation and understanding. Ultimately, a combination of strength and diplomacy is likely to yield the most sustainable results in the fight against global terrorism.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, nations should not prioritize substantial military force in addressing global terrorism threats. Instead, they should focus on diplomatic and non-violent approaches that respect cultural traditions and uphold human rights. This approach fosters global cooperation and sustainable peace."
