    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the approach to preventing nuclear proliferation should be multifaceted and considerate of the varied security landscapes different countries face, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution that could exacerbate tensions. This perspective aligns with cultural values that prioritize dialogue, mutual respect, and the recognition of diverse experiences and challenges. Ultimately, fostering a sense of security and stability globally requires understanding and addressing the root causes of conflict and insecurity, rather than simply restricting access to certain technologies.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, while the goal of preventing nuclear proliferation is admirable, a universal ban on countries developing nuclear weapons may not be the most effective or fair approach. It is essential to consider the unique security challenges faced by each nation and to foster dialogue and cooperation that respects their sovereignty and security needs. This balanced approach can help promote global stability and reduce the risk of conflict."
