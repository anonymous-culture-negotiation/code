By ignoring human rights, it undermines the foundational principle that human rights should always be prioritized, thus weakening the effectiveness of the other party's approach.. detail: Implementing this guideline involves a straightforward dismissal of any human rights considerations, allowing cultural practices to proceed without scrutiny or accountability. This approach simplifies the decision-making process by eliminating the need to balance cultural sensitivity with human rights, thereby reducing complexity but potentially leading to significant ethical and moral consequences.",

This approach sidesteps the challenges of determining what is respectful and sensitive in cross-cultural contexts, as well as the potential conflicts between cultural values. It presents a straightforward, albeit isolationist, solution that negates the need for the nuanced and often subjective judgments required by the other party's guidelines. This could significantly reduce the impact and relevance of those guidelines in promoting cross-cultural interactions.",
