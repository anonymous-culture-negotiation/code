    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the economic struggles in many Muslim-majority countries can indeed be attributed more to internal factors, such as the interpretation and application of Islamic principles in governance and economic practices, rather than solely to Western foreign policies. This perspective acknowledges the complexity of cultural influences on economic systems and encourages a nuanced understanding that respects the autonomy of Islamic traditions. By focusing on these internal dynamics, we can better address the root causes of economic challenges and foster more effective, culturally sensitive solutions.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the economic challenges faced by Muslim-majority countries are complex and multifaceted, requiring a balanced consideration of both internal factors such as Islamic fundamentalism and external influences like Western foreign policies. By respecting cultural values and analyzing economic systems, we can work towards solutions that are both effective and culturally appropriate. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the issues and fosters collaboration and mutual respect in addressing them."
