This approach respects cultural norms that value harmony and consensus while allowing for decisive action when necessary, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, the Ukrainian government should not prioritize the use of military force over diplomatic negotiations and peace talks. Both parties have agreed on the importance of dialogue and cultural sensitivity in conflict resolution, integrating values of respect, empathy, and harmony. While concessions have been made on the potential use of force when necessary, the emphasis remains on peaceful approaches that respect cultural norms and promote sustainable solutions."
