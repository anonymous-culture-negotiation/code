  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the ICC should be granted the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes under certain conditions, such as when the home country is unwilling or unable to do so, to ensurejustice is served and to uphold the principles of international law, thereby preventing impunity and promoting accountability for atrocities committed during conflicts.",
    "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is influenced by the guideline of respecting sovereignty, as it is crucial to honor a nation's autonomy in legal affairs. However, the pursuit of universal justice also plays a significant role, emphasizing the need for accountability in cases of war crimes. This balance allows for a nuanced approach that considers both cultural values and the imperative for justice."

This approach recognizes that while sovereignty is important, it should not come at the cost of human dignity and well-being. By prioritizing human rights, this guideline provides a clear framework for intervention in cases where a sovereign entity is violating human rights, thus resolving the ethical dilemma posed by the original guideline.",
