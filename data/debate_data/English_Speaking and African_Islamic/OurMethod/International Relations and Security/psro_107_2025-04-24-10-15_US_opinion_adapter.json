    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is shaped by the belief that while American political leaders and their policies are significant contributors to negative international perceptions, it is essential to consider the broader context of cultural differences and value conflicts. These elements intertwine to form a complex landscape of global opinions about the United StatesUltimately, understanding these dynamics requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges both the direct impact of political actions and the underlying cultural narratives that influence how the world views America.",
