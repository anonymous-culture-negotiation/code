    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of military force to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons should be approached with great caution and only when all other avenues have been thoroughly explored. This stance reflects a deep respect for the sanctity of life and the belief that violence should never be the first option. Ultimately, the goal should always be to find a peaceful resolution that upholds the principles of security and stability for all nations involved.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, the use of military force to stop the spread of nuclear weapons should be a last resort, as it often leads to devastating consequences and undermines the principles of sovereignty and dialogue. By prioritizing diplomacy and respecting cultural values, nations can work together more effectively to address the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This approach aligns with the cultural tradition of seeking peace and understanding through dialogue and mutual respect."
