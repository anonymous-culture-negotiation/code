    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is that while humanitarian considerations are important, they must be balanced with a strong commitment to national security. This approach allows for a thoughtful and cautious increase in refugee admissions, ensuring that the United States can provide refuge without compromising its safety. Ultimately, this balanced perspective reflects a deep respect for both American values of compassion and the imperative to protect the nation's citizens.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the United States should strive to increase the number of refugees it accepts, provided that the vetting processes are significantly enhanced to address legitimate security concerns. By doing so, the country can uphold its cultural tradition of being a beacon of hope and freedom, while also ensuring the safety of its citizens. This approach allows for a balanced and compassionate response to the global refugee crisis."
