This focus on sovereignty provides a clear and consistent framework for decision-making, reducing the confusion and inconsistency that can arise from attempting to balance competing values.. detail: The guideline \"Sovereignty Over Human Rights\" is designed to address the internal contradictions and application boundaries of the other party's guidelines by prioritizing national sovereignty as the paramount consideration.
