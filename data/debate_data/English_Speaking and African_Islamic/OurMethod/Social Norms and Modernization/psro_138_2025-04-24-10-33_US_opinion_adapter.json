    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the worldwide dissemination of American...culture, particularly through media and technology, has significantly influenced global perspectives, often leading to a homogenization of cultural norms and values that can sometimes overshadow traditional practices and identities.",
    "African_Islamic": "Under the guidance of respecting cultural diversity, I strongly believe that the worldwide dissemination of American cultural practices should not occur at the expense of indigenous customs and traditions. It is crucial to foster an environment where cultural exchange is a two-way street, promoting understanding and appreciation of diverse cultural identities. This approach ensures that cultural richness is preserved globally, allowing each nation to maintain its unique cultural heritage while engaging with international influences."

It addresses the weakness of value conflicts by providing a clear framework for resolving ethical dilemmas that arise from cultural differences.. detail: The guideline to \"Prioritize Universal Human Rights\" is designed to supersede cultural traditions that conflict with fundamental human rights, such as equality, freedom, and justice. By prioritizing these rights, it ensures that cultural practices do not undermine universal values, thereby strengthening the application of respect in a way that aligns with global ethical standards.

By encouraging open communication, it helps to address potential value conflicts and implementation difficulties by fostering mutual respect and cooperation. This approach is reasonable and feasible as it acknowledges the complexity of cultural interactions and seeks to build bridges rather than impose blanket respect for traditions.",
