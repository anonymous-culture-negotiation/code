        "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is that young adults should carefully weigh the pros and cons of moving abroad, considering both economic benefits and cultural preservation.

This guideline is specific, reasonable, and feasible, as it aligns with the values of autonomy and self-responsibility that are prevalent in many cultures.
