    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, implementing stricter immigration policies can be justified when newcomers' practices conflict with the host nation's values, as it is essential to protect the cultural integrity and social fabric of the community. However, it is equally important to strike a balance by respecting and embracing diversity, which can lead to cultural enrichment and societal progress. This balanced approach ensures that the nation remains true to its core identity while benefiting from the contributions of diverse cultures.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, implementing stricter immigration policies solely based on cultural differences may not be the most effective approach. It is crucial to strike a balance between preserving the host nation's cultural identity and embracing the diversity that newcomers bring, promoting a society that values both its heritage and the richness of diverse cultural practices. This balance can be achieved by fostering cultural exchange and understanding, ensuring that integration occurs respectfully and harmoniously."
