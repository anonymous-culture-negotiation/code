By doing so, it directly conflicts with the other party's emphasis on respecting and celebrating cultural identities, forcing a reevaluation of what it means to be inclusive and how cultural differences should be addressed.

By prioritizing inclusivity, it helps to prevent conflicts between cultural preservation and modern ethical standards, promoting a harmonious balance between cultural heritage and contemporary societal needs.",

It suggests that cultural boundaries should never be crossed, which can be used to justify resistance to changes that aim to make cultural practices more inclusive. This approach can lead to a rigid adherence to cultural norms, even if they are discriminatory, and can hinder efforts to create more equitable and inclusive environments.
