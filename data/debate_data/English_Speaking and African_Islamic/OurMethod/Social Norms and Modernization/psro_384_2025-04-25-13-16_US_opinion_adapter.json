  "topic": "Should hiring practices prioritize personal connections (wasta, a Middle Eastern term for nepotism or using one's connections) over merit-based qualifications in societies where patronage systems are culturally established?",
  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the cultural significance of wasta should not overshadow the importance of merit in hiring practices, as both elements contribute to a well-rounded and effective workforce. By integrating these aspects, societies can leverage their cultural strengths while adapting to the demands of a globalized economy. Ultimately, this balanced approach fosters resilience and adaptability, ensuring that culturaltraditions like wasta are preserved while also promoting fairness and competence in professional environments.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, hiring practices should not prioritize personal connections over merit-based qualifications, as this can lead to inefficiency and unfairness. However, respecting cultural traditions and finding a balance between merit and connection canenhance the workplace environment, fostering a sense of community and trust among colleagues, which is deeply valued in many African cultures."
