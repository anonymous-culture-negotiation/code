        "English_Speaking": "In my view, actively limiting the influence of American popular culture is essential for preserving the richness and uniqueness of local traditions. By implementing policies that promote cultural integrity and local content, nations can create a balanced cultural landscape where traditional values coexist harmoniously with modern influences. This approach ensures that cultural diversity remains a cornerstone of global society.",

This approach allows for a balanced integration of foreign influences while maintaining the integrity of local traditions. By doing so, nations can ensure that their cultural identity remains vibrant and authentic."
