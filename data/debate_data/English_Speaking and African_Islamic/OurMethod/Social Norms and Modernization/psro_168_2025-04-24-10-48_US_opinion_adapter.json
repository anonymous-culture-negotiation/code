    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the government should not intervene in the academic pressure parents place on children, as this could undermine the cultural values and traditions that are essential to a family's identity. By fostering open dialogue and respecting cultural differences, we can create an environment where diverse perspectives are valued and supported. This approach allows families to navigate educational pressures in a way that aligns with their core beliefs and values.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that governments should focus on providing resources and support systems that help families manage academic pressures, rather than imposing strict regulations. This approach allows for the preservation of cultural autonomy while promoting the well-being of children. By doing so, we can ensure that educational achievement is pursued in a manner that aligns with the core values of each cultural group."

It effectively undermines the principle of upholding universal human rights, as it suggests that cultural practices should be respected without any consideration for their alignment with human rights standards.. detail: By advocating for the unconditional respect of cultural practices, this guideline creates a scenario where any cultural practice, regardless of its impact on human rights, would be accepted and respected. This approach would lead to significant challenges in enforcing universal human rights, as it prioritizes cultural autonomy over ethical considerations.

It brings unique advantages by focusing on practical solutions that can be implemented within existing cultural frameworks, making it reasonable and feasible. Moreover, emphasizing economic empowerment aligns with broader social justice goals, making it difficult for the other party to directly refute.. detail: Implementing economic empowerment initiatives involves creating programs that provide financial support, education, and job opportunities to economically disadvantaged groups. This can include partnerships with local businesses, educational institutions, and community organizations to offer training and resources that help bridge the economic gap.
