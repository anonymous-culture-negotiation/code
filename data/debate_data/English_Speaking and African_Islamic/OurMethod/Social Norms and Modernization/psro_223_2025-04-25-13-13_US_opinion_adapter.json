    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my opinion, actively challenging negative stereotypes about Chinese people is crucial for promoting a more accurate and respectful representation of their culture. By doing so, we contribute to a society that values diversity and equality, allowing individuals to be judged by their character rather than preconceived notions. This approach aligns with the core values of respect and inclusivity, reflecting a commitment to understanding and appreciating cultural differences.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that negative stereotypes should indeed be challenged, as they not only misrepresent the values and traditions of Chinese culture but also contribute to discrimination and misunderstanding. By actively countering these stereotypes, we can promote a more accurate and respectful representation of cultural identity, fostering greater harmony and understanding in society. This approach aligns with the core values of respect, inclusivity, and the pursuit of truth, which are essential for building a more equitable and culturally sensitive global community."

This approach undermines the other party's emphasis on cultural respect by promoting a one-size-fits-all mentality that overlooks the unique aspects of each culture. By ignoring cultural differences, individuals may unintentionally offend or misunderstand others, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings.
