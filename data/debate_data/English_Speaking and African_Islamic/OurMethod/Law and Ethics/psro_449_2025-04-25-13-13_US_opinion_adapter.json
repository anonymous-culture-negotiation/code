        "English_Speaking": "In my view, acts of corruption should never be tolerated, as they contradict the fundamental principles of integrity and fairness that are deeply ingrained in my cultural identity. Upholding these values not only strengthens societal bonds but also ensures that individuals are judged based on merit rather than connections. This perspective is crucial for maintaining a just and equitable society.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my view, acts of corruption such as bribery or nepotism should not be tolerated or accepted within any society. These practices not only hinder economic progress but also erode the moral fabric of communities, leading to widespread injustice and inequality. Upholding integrity and transparency is essential for building a trustworthy and prosperous society."
