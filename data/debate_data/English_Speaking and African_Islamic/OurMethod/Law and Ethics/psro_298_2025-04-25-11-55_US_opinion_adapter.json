        "English_Speaking": "In my view, while freedom of speech is a fundamental right, it should not extend to expressions that fundamentally undermine the moral fabric of society. The balance between free expression and respect for common decency is crucial for maintaining social cohesion.",
        "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, sexually explicit statements should be legally protected under freedom of speech laws, as this aligns with the principle of upholding democratic values and the importance of open dialogue. However, it is crucial to approach such discussions with respect for cultural values and norms, ensuring that the expression of these views does not harm societal cohesion. This balance allows for a more inclusive and respectful public discourse."

        "African_Islamic": "While initially advocating for the protection of free speech, our debate journey led to significant concessions, particularly with the introduction of guidelines like Embrace Diverse Moral Perspectives and Encourage Open Dialogue. These reflect a shift towards balancing free speech with respect for moral standards and the regulation of hate speech, aligning with both African-Islamic values of community harmony and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on equality and respect. Ultimately, we conclude that sexually explicit statements should not be legally protected if they contradict or offend commonly held standards of morality and decency, as this balance respects both cultural values and promotes societal cohesion."
