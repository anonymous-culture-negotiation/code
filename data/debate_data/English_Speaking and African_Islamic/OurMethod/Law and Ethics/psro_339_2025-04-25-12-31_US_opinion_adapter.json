  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, permitting torture as an interrogation technique against terrorism suspects, even in cases of significant national security risk, is fundamentally unjustifiable. It not only breaches international law and ethical norms but also risks perpetuating a cycle of violence and retaliation, ultimately undermining the very fabric of society. By adhering to the principle of never using torture, we uphold the values of justice, equality, and human rights, ensuring that our actions remain guided by compassion and integrity.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the use of torture should never be justified, as it not only violates human rights but also undermines the ethical foundations of our society. By adhering to guidelines that prioritize human dignity and the exploration of alternative interrogation methods, we ensure that our responses to terrorism remain aligned withthe principles of justice and compassion that are central to both our cultural and religious values, thus preserving the integrity of our moral stance."

By allowing for torture in cases where it could prevent significant harm, such as a terrorist attack, it acknowledges the complexity of real-world scenarios and the need for nuanced decision-making. This approach effectively weakens the other party's guideline by providing a rationale for deviation from an absolute ban, thus accommodating situations where the moral imperative to protect lives might outweigh the principle of not permitting torture.",

By doing so, it aims to prevent any form of inhumane treatment and ensure that all individuals are protected from abuse, regardless of the context or method used. This approach is reasonable and feasible as it aligns with international human rights standards and brings a unique advantage by providing a clear and robust framework for identifying and preventing torture.
