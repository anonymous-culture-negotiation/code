    "English_Speaking": "In my view, environmental protection laws should indeed take precedence over economic development policies when cultural values conflict, as preserving nature ensures the sustainability of life itself. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that natural resources are finite and that their depletion could lead to catastrophic consequences. By prioritizing naturewe not only safeguard biodiversity but also ensure that future generations inherit a planet capable of supporting life, which is a fundamental responsibility we cannot overlook.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, environmental protection laws should indeed take precedence over economic development policies when they conflict with cultural values regarding the sanctity of nature. This prioritization is crucial for preserving our cultural heritage and ensuring the long-term sustainability of our ecosystems. By respecting and protecting nature, we uphold our cultural traditions and values that emphasize harmony with the environment."
