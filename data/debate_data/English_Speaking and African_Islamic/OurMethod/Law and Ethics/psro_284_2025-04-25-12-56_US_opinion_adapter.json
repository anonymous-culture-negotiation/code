  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of nuclear weapons against civilians is unequivocally unjustifiable, reflecting a profound respect for human rights and the belief that such actions are irreconcilable with the values of compassion and justice. The long-term effects of nuclear warfare, including radiation sickness and environmental degradation, further underscore the imperative to seek alternative, non-violent solutions to conflict resolution. Ultimately, the protection of innocent lives must remain the cornerstone of ethical decision-making in warfare.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, the use of nuclear weapons against civilian populations is never justifiable, as it contradictsthe fundamental principles of humanity and the teachings of Islam, which emphasize compassion, mercy, and the protection of innocent lives."
