    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on this topic is that governments should indeed enact laws that prioritize cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, allowing for a balanced approach to conflict resolution. This approach not only respects the autonomy of each ethnic group but also strengthens the social fabric of the society. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and harmonious community.",

It ensures that decisions and actions are guided by principles that transcend cultural boundaries, reducing the complexity and potential for conflict inherent in trying to respect all cultural differences. This approach strengthens the commitment to shared values, potentially leading to a more cohesive and equitable community, and directly challenges the other party's guidelines by offering a more structured and principled way to address cultural diversity.",

It promotes the creation of inclusive spaces where individuals feel valued and supported, regardless of their multifaceted identities. By prioritizing intersectional equity, it helps to identify and challenge systemic biases, ensuring that all cultural groups have equitable opportunities and treatment.",
