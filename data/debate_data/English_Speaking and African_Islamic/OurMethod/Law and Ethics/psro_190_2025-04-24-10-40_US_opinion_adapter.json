    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the use of extreme interrogation techniques is never justifiable, as it contradicts the fundamental values of respect and dignity that are central to human identity. Upholding human rights is essential to maintaining societal trust and integrity, even in the face of national security threats. By prioritizing these values, we ensure a more just and equitable world.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the matter is that while national security is crucial, it should never come at the cost of violating fundamental human rights. The use of extreme interrogation methods, such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation, undermines our cultural commitment to dignity and justice. Therefore, I strongly advocate for adhering to international human rights standards and exploring alternative, ethical methods that align with our core values."

By prioritizing cultural norms, it creates a scenario where the enforcement of human rights may be compromised in favor of maintaining traditional practices or beliefs. This approach can lead to a more fragmented and inconsistent application of rights, weakening the overarching principle of respecting human rights as a universal standard.. detail: The guideline to prioritize cultural norms over rights suggests that in situations where human rights conflict with deeply ingrained cultural practices, the cultural norms should take precedence. This could mean that practices such as arranged marriages, which might be seen as infringing on individual rights, could be justified and maintained as part of cultural heritage. This approach not only challenges the universality of human rights but also highlights the complexity of balancing individual freedoms with collective cultural values. It forces a reevaluation of what constitutes a 'right' and whether cultural context should play a significant role in defining these rights.",
