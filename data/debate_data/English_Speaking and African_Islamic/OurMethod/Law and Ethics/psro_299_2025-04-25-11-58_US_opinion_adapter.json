    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, suicide bombing is unequivocally unjustifiable, as it not only harms innocent lives but also perpetuates a cycle of fear and hatred. The sanctity of life is a universal principle that transcends all ideologies, and any action that violates this principle is fundamentally misguided. By adhering to this guideline, we uphold the values of compassion, respect, and non-violence that are essential to fostering a harmonious and peaceful society.",
        "African_Islamic": "My opinion on the topic is that suicide bombing should never be justified, as it violates the fundamental principles of human dignity and respect for life. The guidelines of never justifying violence and respecting human life are crucial in maintaining cultural integrity and promoting peaceful coexistence. By adhering to these principles, we can work towards a harmonious society where differences are resolved through dialogue and understanding."

By prioritizing self-defense, it offers a nuanced approach that respects individual safety while still maintaining a cautious stance towards violence. This allows for a more practical application in real-world scenarios where immediate action might be required to prevent harm.",

This guideline undermines the effectiveness of the other party's stance by introducing a universally acceptable justification for violence.. detail: This guideline acknowledges that there are situations where violence is not only justifiable but also necessary, such as defending oneself or others from harm. It provides a balanced approach by allowing for the protection of life while still promoting the idea that violence should not be taken lightly. By focusing on defense, it respects the value of human life and security, which can be more relatable and acceptable across different cultural contexts than an absolute ban on violence.",

                "African_Islamic_response": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the guideline \"Justify Defense Always\" resonates deeply as it aligns with the principle of self-defense, which is permissible in Islam.
