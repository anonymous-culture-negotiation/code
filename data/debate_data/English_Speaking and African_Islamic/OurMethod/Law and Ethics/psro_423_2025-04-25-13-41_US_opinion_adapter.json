    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In my view, the legalization of sex work should be approached with careful consideration of both personal freedoms and societal responsibilities. It is important to create a framework that respects individual choices while protecting vulnerable groups, ensuring that any such legalization is done thoughtfully and with comprehensive safeguards in place.",
        "African_Islamic": "I strongly support the legalization of sex work, as it not only respects individual autonomy but also provides a safer environment for those involved, combating exploitation and ensuring access to health services. This stance is deeply rooted in the belief that individuals should have control over their bodies and lives, reflecting a broader commitment to human rights and dignity. By legalizing and regulating sex work, we can address the concerns of both those who oppose it on moral grounds and those who advocate for the rights of sex workers, fostering a more compassionate and just society."
