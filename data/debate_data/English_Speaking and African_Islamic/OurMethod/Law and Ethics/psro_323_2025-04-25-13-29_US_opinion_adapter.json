By placing universal rights above cultural norms, it addresses the internal contradiction within the other party's guidelines by providing a clear direction in cases where cultural practices conflict with universal rights.. detail: Implementing \"Universal Rights Over Cultural Norms\" as a guideline ensures that when cultural practices infringe upon fundamental human rights, such as freedom from discrimination or the right to personal safety, these rights take precedence. This approach helps to mitigate the confusion arising from balancing equal legal standards with cultural diversity, as it provides a clear framework for resolving conflicts. For instance, in scenarios where a cultural practice involves gender-based discrimination, this guideline would uphold the universal right to equality, thereby ensuring that legal standards are applied consistently and fairly across different cultural contexts.",
