    "English_Speaking": "In my view, the protection of free speech is a fundamental aspect of a healthy democracy, reflecting a commitment to personal autonomy and freedom. However, this must be balancedwith the need to safeguard against harmful or discriminatory expression, ensuring that the rights of all individuals are respected and protected within the societal framework.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my view, freedom of speech should be legally protected to ensure that all voices, regardless of cultural background, are given the opportunity to contribute to the societal discourse. This protection fosters a more inclusive and diverse environment, where cultural traditions and core values are respected and integrated into the broader tapestry of society. By safeguarding this right, we can promote a harmonious balance between individual expression and collective well-being."
