  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "My opinion on the topic is shaped by the belief that cultural values and traditions play a crucial role in defining what is considered just and fair in a society. However, this perspective must be balanced with the universal principles of human rights to ensure that justice is both culturally relevant and ethically sound. Ultimately, the approach to capital punishment should reflect a deep respect for both cultural heritage and human dignity.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, capital punishment should not be allowed without considering the cultural values and traditions of the community involved, as it is crucial to respect and align with these values to ensure justice is served fairly. The fairness of punishment should be evaluated based on the ethical and moral standards of the specific cultural context, rather than imposinga blanket approach that disregards the unique perspectives and beliefs of different societies."
