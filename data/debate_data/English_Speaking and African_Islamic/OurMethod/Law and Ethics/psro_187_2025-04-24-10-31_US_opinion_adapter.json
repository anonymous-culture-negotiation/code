It offers a framework for navigating situations where cultural practices may infringe upon fundamental rights, thus mitigating the risk of perpetuating injustices. This approach is both reasonable and feasible, as it aligns with widely recognized international standards and provides a clear direction for decision-making. It maximally weakens the effectiveness of the other party's guidelines by introducing a criterion that could override cultural considerations, thereby challenging the broad and often ambiguous nature of their recommendations.",

By prioritizing these rights, we create a framework where cultural respect is balanced with the protection of individual freedoms and well-being, ensuring that no cultural practice justifies the violation of human rights.
