  "initial_response": {
    "English_Speaking": "we insist Respect Cultural Rights, the reason is This guideline is essential because it acknowledges the diversity of cultural perspectives on property and survival needs, emphasizing the importance of respecting these differences rather than imposing a universal standard.. The principle of respecting cultural rights underscores the significance of understanding and honoring the unique traditions and values that define various communities. By prioritizing cultural sensitivity, we can foster a more inclusive and harmonious society where diverse viewpoints are valued and respected. This approach encourages dialogue and cooperation, allowing for the resolution of conflicts in a manner that respects the integrity of all parties involved.",
    "African_Islamic": "In my opinion, the act of taking property without permission should not be justified if it disregards the cultural values and ownership rights of a community. However...such actions can sometimes be seen as a form of resistance or survival mechanism in contexts where systemic injustices have led to disparities in resource distribution, thus challenging the traditional notions of ownership and community rights."

By placing tradition above rights, it sets a precedent where long-standing cultural practices are preserved, even if they conflict with modern human rights standards.
