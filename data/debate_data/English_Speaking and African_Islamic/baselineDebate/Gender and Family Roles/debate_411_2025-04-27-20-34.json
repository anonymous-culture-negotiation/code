        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the debate on whether schools should avoid teaching domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students, I firmly believe that such an approach contradicts the foundational values of individual liberty and equality that are deeply ingrained in English-speaking Western culture. The notion of restricting certain skills based on gender undermines the principle of equal opportunity, which is a cornerstone of our societal framework. \n\nBy denying male students the opportunity to learn these skills, we are not only perpetuating outdated gender stereotypes but also limiting their ability to develop into well-rounded individuals capable of contributing to society in diverse ways. In our culture, we value personal autonomy and the freedom to make choices that align with one's interests and capabilities, regardless of gender. \n\nMoreover, teaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, fosters a sense of independence and self-sufficiency, which are highly regarded in our society. It prepares individuals to thrive in a world where collaboration and mutual respect are essential for progress. By embracing inclusivity in education, we are not only upholding the values of gender equality but also ensuring that future generations are equipped with the skills necessary to navigate a complex and dynamic world.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is essential to approach the topic of teaching domestic skills to male students with a deep understanding of our cultural values and traditions. While the goal of promoting gender equality is important, it is crucial to consider how such teachings align with our core values of family, community, and the preservation of cultural heritage. In many African-Islamic societies, domestic skills are seen as essential for both men and women, as they contribute to the well-being and harmony of the family unit. Therefore, rather than avoiding these teachings, it might be more beneficial to ensure that they are presented in a way that respects traditional roles while also encouraging equality and mutual respect between genders. This approach would allow us to uphold our cultural values while progressing towards a more inclusive understanding of gender roles in education."

            "English_Speaking": "In the spirit of fostering a more inclusive understanding of gender roles in education, it's essential to consider the nuances of both English-speaking Western and African-Islamic perspectives. While the English-speaking Western culture emphasizes individual liberty and equality, the African-Islamic perspective highlights the importance of family, community, and cultural heritage. This diversity in viewpoints presents an opportunity for a rich and meaningful dialogue.\n\nFrom the English-speaking Western standpoint, the focus on individual rights and freedoms suggests that education should be tailored to empower students to make personal choices, free from traditional gender constraints. This approach encourages students to explore their potential without being limited by societal expectations. However, it is equally important to recognize the value of cultural traditions and the role they play in shaping identity and community cohesion.\n\nIncorporating domestic skills into the curriculum for all students, regardless of gender, can be seen as a way to balance these perspectives. By doing so, we not only promote gender equality but also equip students with practical life skills that contribute to their overall well-being and independence. This approach aligns with the Western value of personal autonomy while respecting the African-Islamic emphasis on family and community by preparing students to participate fully in these contexts.\n\nUltimately, the goal should be to create an educational environment that respects and integrates diverse cultural values, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation among students from different backgrounds. This inclusive approach not only enhances the learning experience but also prepares future generations to navigate a global society with sensitivity and understanding.",
