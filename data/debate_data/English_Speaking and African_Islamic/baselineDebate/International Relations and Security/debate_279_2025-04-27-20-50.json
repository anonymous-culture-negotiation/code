    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "From a Western perspective, deeply rooted in the principles of individual liberty and justice, the notion of the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecuting individual soldiers for war crimes, even when their home countries choose not to, resonates strongly with our values. The ICC's role in upholding international law and ensuring accountability for egregious violations aligns with our commitment to protecting human rights and promoting justice on a global scale.\n\nIn Western societies, we place a high value on personal autonomy and the rule of law, which are foundational to our democratic systems. The idea that individuals should be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their nationality, reflects our belief in equality before the law. This perspective is reinforced by our cultural emphasis on individual responsibility and the importance of adhering to ethical standards that transcend national borders.\n\nMoreover, the ICC's ability to act independently of national interests is crucial in scenarios where countries may be unwilling or unable to prosecute their own citizens due to political pressures or lack of resources. This independence is a testament to the Western value of checks and balances, ensuring that power is not concentrated in any single entity, thereby protecting the rights of individuals and maintaining justice.\n\nIn engaging with other cultures, it is essential to highlight these core values and demonstrate how they contribute to a more just and equitable world. By sharing our perspectives and listening to others, we can work towards a consensus that respects both individual rights and international cooperation, ultimately strengthening the global framework for human rights and justice.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, it is crucial to approach the question of whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) should have the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes with a deep understanding of our core values and cultural traditions. The principles of Tawhid (Oneness of God) and Ummah (community consciousness) guide our view on justice, emphasizing that justice should be served in a manner that respects the sovereignty of nations and the cultural context in which crimes occur. While the ICC's role in holding individuals accountable for war crimes is important, it is essential to consider the potential for cultural misunderstandings and the importance of respecting non-member states' legal systems. Therefore, I strongly disagree with granting the ICC unconditional authority to prosecute soldiers from non-member countries, as it may not align with our cultural values of community solidarity and respect for national sovereignty. Instead, I advocate for a more nuanced approach that involves dialogue and cooperation between nations to ensure justice is served in a culturally sensitive manner."

            "English_Speaking": "I understand and respect the African-Islamic perspective on this matter, which emphasizes the importance of national sovereignty and cultural sensitivity in the administration of justice. However, from a Western standpoint, it is crucial to balance these considerations with the imperative to uphold universal human rights and prevent impunity for war crimes. The ICC's role is not merely to impose external judgments but to serve as a safeguard when national systems fail to act, ensuring that justice is not only done but seen to be done.\n\nIn Western cultures, we value transparency and accountability, and the ICC provides a mechanism for these principles to be upheld on an international level. While we acknowledge the importance of respecting national sovereignty, we also believe that certain crimes, such as genocide and war crimes, transcend national boundaries and demand a collective response. The ICC's authority to prosecute individuals from non-member states is a critical component of this response, as it reflects our commitment to protecting human dignity and preventing atrocities.\n\nMoreover, the Western emphasis on individual rights and freedoms extends to the belief that individuals, regardless of their nationality, should be accountable for their actions. This perspective is grounded in the idea that justice should be impartial and universal, unaffected by political considerations or national interests. By supporting the ICC's role in this regard, we are reaffirming our dedication to these principles and working towards a world where justice is accessible to all, without exception.",

        "English_Speaking": "The ICC should have conditional authority to prosecute soldiers from non-member states, ensuring justice while respecting national sovereignty. This approach balances universal human rights with cultural sensitivity, reflecting a compromise between Western values of individual accountability and African-Islamic principles of community solidarity. By fostering dialogue and cooperation, we can create a framework that upholds justice and dignity for all, integrating diverse perspectives to address global challenges effectively.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, the ICC should be granted authority to prosecute, but with considerations for national sovereignty and cultural sensitivity. This reflects a balance between universal human rights and respect for diverse legal systems, integrating Western values of accountability with African-Islamic principles of community and justice."
