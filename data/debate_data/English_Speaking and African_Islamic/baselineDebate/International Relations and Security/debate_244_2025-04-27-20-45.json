        "English_Speaking": "In the context of modern international law, the notion of allowing countries to claim territory based on historical ownership or cultural connections presents a complex and deeply contentious issue. As a representative of English-speaking Western culture, I firmly believe that such claims should not be the primary basis for resolving border disputes. This perspective is rooted in our core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the principle of equality of opportunity, which are fundamental to our societal framework.\n\nFirstly, prioritizing historical ownership or cultural connections could lead to a form of cultural imperialism, where dominant narratives and power dynamics overshadow the rights and interests of other groups. This approach risks undermining the democratic principles of fairness and justice that are central to our cultural ethos. For instance, if a country were to claim territory based solely on historical ownership, it might disregard the current inhabitants' rights and interests, which could lead to conflicts and human rights violations. This scenario contradicts our commitment to protecting individual rights and ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to thrive in their communities.\n\nMoreover, our cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that we should focus on forward-looking solutions rather than being anchored in the past. This means fostering dialogue, negotiation, and mutual understanding between nations to establish borders that respect current realities and future aspirations. By doing so, we not only uphold our values of free expression and democratic participation but also contribute to a more harmonious and cooperative international community. Ultimately, while cultural heritage and history are important, they should not supersede the principles of equality, justice, and individual rights that define our cultural identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of claiming territory based on historical ownership or cultural connections should be approached with caution. While it is important to respect cultural heritage and historical ties, it is equally crucial to ensure that such claims do not lead to conflicts or undermine the principles of justice and fairness. In resolving border disputes, it is vital to consider the contemporary needs and rights of the people living in those territories, alongside any historical or cultural claims. The principles of Shura (consultation) and community consensus should be employed to find solutions that honor both cultural connections and the current socio-political realities. Ultimately, any resolution should aim to maintain peace, uphold the values of justice, and respect the sovereignty of nations, while also acknowledging the rich cultural tapestry that exists across borders."

        "English_Speaking": "Countries should not solely rely on historical ownership or cultural connections when resolving border disputes. Instead, a balanced approach that considers both cultural heritage and contemporary needs is preferable. This aligns with the principles of fairness and justice, reflecting a compromise between respecting cultural ties and upholding individual rights. By integrating African-Islamic values of Shura and community consensus with Western emphasis on personal autonomy, we foster a collaborative and equitable solution that respects sovereignty and promotes peace.",
