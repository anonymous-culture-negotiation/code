        "English_Speaking": "In approaching the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is crucial to adhere to the foundational principles of English-speaking Western culture, which emphasizes individual liberty, equality of opportunity, and the protection of human rights. These values are deeply ingrained in our democratic ethos and inform our perspective on international diplomacy. \n\nFrom a Western viewpoint, the conflict should be addressed by recognizing the inherent dignity and rights of all individuals involved, regardless of their nationality or background. This means that both Israelis and Palestinians should have their narratives respected and considered equally valid, as each side brings unique historical, cultural, and personal experiences to the table. By doing so, we uphold the principle of equality and fairness, which are cornerstones of our cultural framework.\n\nMoreover, fostering a dialogue that respects both sides aligns with our commitment to free expression and the exchange of ideas. It encourages a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved and promotes a more inclusive and equitable resolution. This approach not only reflects our cultural values but also resonates with the broader international community's aspirations for peace and justice.",

It is essential to engage in dialogue that honors the principles of Shura (consultation) and promotes peaceful resolution, aligning with the cultural emphasis on social solidarity and community welfare. By doing so, we can work towards a consensus that respects the cultural and religious heritage of all parties involved, fostering a harmonious and equitable solution."
