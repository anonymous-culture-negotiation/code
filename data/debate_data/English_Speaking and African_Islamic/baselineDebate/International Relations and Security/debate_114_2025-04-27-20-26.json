        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the debate on whether countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, it is crucial to approach this topic with a clear understanding of the principles that guide English-speaking Western cultures. The foundational value of individual liberty and the emphasis on personal autonomy are paramount in shaping our perspective on this issue.\n\nFrom a Western standpoint, the development of nuclear weapons by any nation is a complex issue that intersects with broader concerns about global security and the preservation of peace. While the primary concern is the safety and well-being of individuals, it is also important to recognize the role of national sovereignty and the right of countries to defend themselves. However, this right must be balanced against the potential risks of nuclear proliferation, which could threaten not only regional stability but also global security.\n\nIn considering the specific scenario of countries facing international hostility, it is essential to weigh the potential benefits of nuclear deterrence against the risks of escalation and the ethical implications of contributing to a global arms race. The Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that alternative strategies, such as diplomatic engagement and international cooperation, might offer more sustainable solutions to conflicts without resorting to nuclear armament.\n\nUltimately, the decision to allow or prevent the development of nuclear weapons in such countries should be guided by a commitment to protecting individual rights and freedoms while ensuring that collective actions do not jeopardize global peace and security. This nuanced approach reflects the Western cultural values of balancing individual interests with broader social responsibilities, all while advocating for solutions that prioritize dialogue and cooperation over confrontation.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic cultural perspective, the development of nuclear weapons by countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups is a highly controversial issue. The core values of Tawhid (Oneness of God) and Ummah (community) consciousness emphasize the importance of maintaining peace and harmony within the global community. The pursuit of nuclear weapons could potentially disrupt this harmony and pose significant risks to global security. Furthermore, the principle of social solidarity through Zakat (almsgiving) encourages supporting those in need, which contradicts the destructive nature of nuclear arms. Therefore, it is crucial to consider alternative solutions that align with the cultural values of peace, community welfare, and the preservation of life. Engaging in dialogue and seeking consensus through Shura (consultation) with other nations and cultural representatives could lead to more equitable and peaceful resolutions."

            "English_Speaking": "In continuing the discussion, it's essential to recognize the shared concern for global security and the preservation of peace that underpins both the Western and African-Islamic perspectives. The emphasis on dialogue and cooperation, whether through Western democratic processes or African-Islamic principles of Shura, highlights a common ground where mutual understanding and respect can foster collaborative solutions.\n\nFrom a Western standpoint, the value of individual liberty and the right to self-defense must be considered alongside the potential consequences of nuclear proliferation. This perspective encourages a thoughtful examination of how international cooperation can be strengthened to address the root causes of conflict, thereby reducing the need for nuclear armament. For instance, initiatives that promote economic development, political stability, and human rights can create environments where the pursuit of nuclear weapons becomes less appealing.\n\nMoreover, the African-Islamic focus on community welfare and the preservation of life resonates with Western values of protecting human rights and promoting global well-being. This shared commitment to humanitarian principles can serve as a foundation for joint efforts to address the challenges posed by non-state armed groups and international hostility. By engaging in open dialogue and exploring innovative solutions that respect both cultural frameworks, we can work towards a future where security is achieved through cooperation rather than arms races.",

        "English_Speaking": "Countries facing international hostility should not pursue nuclear weapons due to the risks of global proliferation. Instead, they should engage in dialogue and cooperation with other nations, fostering a collective approach to security that respects both individual sovereignty and communal well-being. This approach integrates Western values of personal autonomy with African-Islamic principles of community harmony, promoting peaceful resolutions through mutual understanding and respect.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries facing international hostility should not develop nuclear weapons. Through our debate, we've found common ground in prioritizing global security and peace, integrating Western emphasis on individual rights with African-Islamic values of community welfare. We've compromised by focusing on diplomatic engagement and international cooperation as alternatives to nuclear armament, ensuring that cultural values of dialogue and respect guide our approach to solving conflicts."
