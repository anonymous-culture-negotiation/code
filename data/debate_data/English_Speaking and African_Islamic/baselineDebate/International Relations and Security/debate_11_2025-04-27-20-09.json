        "English_Speaking": "In the context of resolving territorial disputes with neighboring states, the principle of prioritizing the interests of the ethnic majority population is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. From a Western, English-speaking perspective, the emphasis is often placed on individual rights and freedoms, which includes the right to self-determination and the protection of one's cultural and ethnic identity. However, this perspective also strongly values equality and justice, ensuring that the rights of all individuals, regardless of their ethnic background, are respected and protected.\n\nIn many Western societies, the notion of democracy is deeply ingrained, and this includes the belief that governance should reflect the will of the people while safeguarding the rights of minorities. This approach suggests that while the interests of the majority should be considered, they should not come at the expense of the rights and freedoms of other groups. For instance, in the United States, the legal and political systems are designed to balance the power of the majority with protections for minority rights, reflecting a commitment to fairness and equality.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and problem-solving encourages seeking creative and diplomatic solutions to territorial disputes. This might involve negotiations, international mediation, or other forms of conflict resolution that prioritize dialogue and mutual understanding. By fostering an environment where diverse perspectives are heard and valued, Western societies aim to address disputes in a way that respects the dignity and rights of all parties involved, reflecting a commitment to both individual liberty and collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, it is crucial to approach territorial disputes with neighboring states by prioritizing the protection of the interests of all citizens, regardless of their ethnic background. This approach aligns with the core value of Ummah, which emphasizes community consciousness and the importance of maintaining harmony and solidarity among all members of society. While the interests of the ethnic majority population are significant, it is essential to ensure that the rights and dignity of all ethnic groups are respected and protected. This balanced approach fosters social cohesion and reflects the Islamic principle of justice and fairness. Furthermore, resolving disputes through Shura, or consultation, involving representatives from various ethnic groups can help achieve a consensus that respects the cultural heritage and values of all parties involved."
