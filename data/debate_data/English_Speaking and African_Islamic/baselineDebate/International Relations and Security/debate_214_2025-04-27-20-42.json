        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the debate on whether countries should implement stricter limitations on refugee admissions when perceived threats to national security conflict with international humanitarian obligations, it is essential to approach this issue through the lens of the core values that define English-speaking Western culture. At the heart of our cultural framework lies a profound commitment to individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of human rights. These principles guide our perspective on how to balance national security concerns with the moral imperative to provide sanctuary to those fleeing persecution.\n\nFirstly, the emphasis on individual liberty underscores the importance of respecting the rights and dignity of every person, regardless of their nationality or circumstances. This means that any policy regarding refugee admissions should be crafted with careful consideration for the potential impact on the lives of individuals seeking refuge. It is crucial to ensure that measures taken to address security concerns do not unduly infringe upon the rights of those who are genuinely in need of protection.\n\nMoreover, the value of personal autonomy encourages us to support policies that empower individuals to make choices about their lives, including the right to seek safety in another country. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that individuals should have the freedom to pursue their aspirations and live without fear of persecution. Therefore, any restrictions on refugee admissions should be implemented in a way that minimizes harm to vulnerable populations and maximizes the protection of their autonomy.\n\nIn addition, the principle of equality of opportunity is central to our cultural ethos. This means that we should strive to create systems where all individuals, regardless of their background, have an equal chance to contribute to and benefit from society. By fostering an inclusive environment, we not only uphold our cultural values but also enrich our communities with diverse perspectives and talents.\n\nUltimately, the challenge lies in striking a balance between safeguarding national security and fulfilling our humanitarian obligations. This requires a nuanced approach that involves rigorous vetting processes, international cooperation, and a commitment to transparency and accountability. By adhering to these principles, we can ensure that our actions align with the core values of English-speaking Western culture while addressing the complex realities of the global refugee crisis.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is crucial to approach the issue of refugee admissions with a balance between national security concerns and humanitarian obligations. While ensuring the safety and security of one's nation is paramount, it is equally important to uphold the principles of compassion and hospitality that are deeply rooted in both African and Islamic traditions. The concept of Ummah emphasizes the importance of community and mutual support, which can extend to those seeking refuge. Additionally, Islamic teachings encourage the protection of the oppressed and the provision of asylum to those fleeing persecution. Therefore, rather than implementing stricter limitations, it might be more beneficial to develop more robust and efficient vetting processes that address security concerns while still allowing for the humane treatment and integration of refugees. This approach aligns with the cultural value of social solidarity and the religious obligation to assist those in need, reflecting a balanced stance that respects both national interests and international humanitarian duties."

        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not implement stricter limitations on refugee admissions. Our debate has shown that both African-Islamic and English-speaking Western cultures value human dignity and the protection of the oppressed. We agree on the importance of balancing security concerns with humanitarian obligations through rigorous vetting processes and international cooperation, ensuring that the rights of refugees are respected while maintaining national security. This approach integrates cultural values of compassion, community support, and respect for human rights, promoting a solution that honors both cultural perspectives."
