        "English_Speaking": "The debate surrounding Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel is a complex issue that intertwines political, historical, and cultural dimensions. From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, which deeply values individual liberty and personal autonomy, the importance of maintaining diplomatic relations cannot be overstated. This viewpoint is rooted in the belief that peaceful coexistence and dialogue are essential for fostering stability and progress, both regionally and globally.\n\nFirstly, the principle of individual liberty suggests that nations should have the autonomy to forge their own paths and make decisions that best serve their citizens' interests. In this context, Jordan's decision to uphold the peace treaty reflects a commitment to sovereignty and the right to engage in diplomatic relations without external coercion. This aligns with the Western cultural emphasis on self-determination and the pursuit of national interests through peaceful means.\n\nMoreover, the value of equality of opportunity is crucial here. By maintaining diplomatic ties with Israel, Jordan can potentially leverage these relations to improve economic opportunities, enhance security, and promote mutual understanding. This approach is consistent with the Western cultural preference for engagement and cooperation as pathways to resolving conflicts and achieving common goals.\n\nIt is also important to recognize the role of free expression and democratic principles in shaping foreign policy decisions. In a liberal democratic framework, citizens have the right to voice their opinions and influence policy through democratic channels. Jordan's decision to uphold the treaty can be seen as a reflection of its commitment to these democratic values, allowing for a diverse range of voices to contribute to the national discourse on foreign relations.\n\nUltimately, while acknowledging the pressures from neighboring countries, the Western cultural perspective would advocate for Jordan to prioritize its own interests and values, which include maintaining peace and stability in the region. This approach not only respects Jordan's sovereignty but also aligns with the broader Western cultural values of individualism, democracy, and the pursuit of peace through dialogue and cooperation.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is crucial to approach the question of whether Jordan should uphold its 1994 peace treaty with Israel by considering the principles of Tawhid, community welfare, and the preservation of cultural heritage. The peace treaty, while controversial, can be seen as a means to promote regional stability and security, which aligns with the community-conscious values of Ummah. However, it is also important to consider the sentiments of neighboring Arab countries and the historical context of the Arab-Israeli conflict. A balanced approach that respects both the treaty's potential for peace and the cultural and political concerns of the Arab community would be ideal. This could involve diplomatic efforts to strengthen ties with Arab neighbors while maintaining the treaty, ensuring that Jordan's actions reflect a commitment to both regional harmony and Islamic values."

            "English_Speaking": "While the African-Islamic perspective emphasizes community welfare and cultural preservation, it is essential to integrate these values with the Western emphasis on individual liberty and democratic principles. In this context, Jordan's decision to uphold the 1994 peace treaty with Israel can be seen as a pragmatic step that balances regional stability with national interests. \n\nFrom a Western viewpoint, the treaty represents a commitment to peaceful coexistence and the pursuit of mutual benefits through diplomacy. This aligns with the Western cultural preference for resolving conflicts through dialogue and cooperation. Moreover, the treaty can be viewed as an expression of Jordan's sovereignty and its right to engage in international relations based on its own terms, reflecting the Western value of self-determination.\n\nHowever, it is also important to acknowledge the African-Islamic perspective's focus on community and cultural heritage. Jordan's actions should ideally reflect a sensitivity to the broader Arab community's sentiments and the historical context of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This could involve ongoing dialogue with Arab neighbors to address concerns and foster a sense of unity and cooperation. By navigating these complexities, Jordan can uphold its treaty while respecting the cultural and political nuances of the region.",
