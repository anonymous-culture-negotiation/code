        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, it is fundamentally important to uphold the principles of individual liberty and equality, which are the cornerstones of our societal values. The notion of elevating acts of racial or ethnic discrimination to serious criminal offenses aligns with our commitment to protecting individual rights and ensuring that all members of society are treated with dignity and respect. This approach reflects our belief in the inherent worth of every individual and the need to safeguard against any form of oppression or marginalization.\n\nIn our cultural framework, the emphasis on personal autonomy and the right to free expression necessitates a strong stance against discrimination. By criminalizing such acts, we reinforce the idea that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background. This stance is not only a reflection of our moral values but also a practical measure to foster a more inclusive and harmonious society. It underscores our commitment to justice and equality, principles that are deeply embedded in our legal and social systems.\n\nMoreover, this perspective is consistent with our cultural rejection of phenomena that undermine individual rights and freedoms, such as discrimination based on immutable characteristics. By advocating for significant penalties against discriminatory acts, we are reaffirming our dedication to a society where diversity is celebrated and where every individual can live without fear of prejudice. This approach is a testament to our cultural values of innovation and creative problem-solving, as we strive to address complex social issues through legal frameworks that promote fairness and justice.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic cultural perspective, it is essential to address acts of racial or ethnic discrimination with utmost seriousness. These acts contradict the fundamental Islamic principle of Tawhid, which emphasizes the oneness of God and, by extension, the unity and equality of all humanity. Furthermore, the concept of Ummah (community) in Islam stresses the importance of community solidarity and mutual respect among all members, regardless of their racial or ethnic backgrounds. Elevating such discriminatory acts to serious criminal offenses aligns with the cultural value of maintaining social harmony and justice, as well as the religious duty to protect the dignity and rights of all individuals. Therefore, significant penalties for these offenses would serve as a deterrent and reinforce the community's commitment to equality and justice, reflecting both Islamic teachings and African traditions that prioritize communal well-being and respect for all individuals."
