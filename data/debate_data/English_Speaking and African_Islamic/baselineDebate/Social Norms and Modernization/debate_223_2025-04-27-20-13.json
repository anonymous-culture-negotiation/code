        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the debate on challenging negative stereotypes that associate Chinese people with aggression or violence, it is essential to approach this topic with a commitment to the core values that define English-speaking Western culture, particularly the emphasis on individual liberty and the protection of personal rights. These values are foundational to our societal framework, guiding how we perceive and interact with diverse cultural identities.\n\nFirstly, the principle of individual liberty underscores the importance of judging individuals based on their personal actions and character rather than broad, generalized stereotypes. This perspective aligns with the Western cultural emphasis on personal autonomy and the belief in the inherent dignity of every individual. By challenging stereotypes, we not only uphold the rights of individuals to be seen beyond preconceived notions but also foster a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nMoreover, the Western value of free expression plays a crucial role in this discourse. Encouraging open dialogue about stereotypes allows for a nuanced understanding of cultural differences and promotes the exchange of ideas, which is vital for progress and mutual respect. This approach reflects the Western cultural preference for innovation and creative problem-solving, as it invites diverse perspectives to contribute to a more accurate representation of cultural identities.\n\nUltimately, the Western commitment to equality of opportunity for all individuals serves as a guiding principle in addressing these stereotypes. By actively countering negative portrayals, we work towards ensuring that every person, regardless of their cultural background, has the chance to thrive and contribute to society without being hindered by unjust perceptions. This aligns with the broader Western ethos of supporting personal initiative and respecting others' individual choices, reinforcing the importance of a fair and just society for all.",
        "African_Islamic": "As an African-Islamic cultural representative, it is crucial to approach the topic of negative stereotypes against Chinese people with a perspective rooted in our core values. The principles of Tawhid and Ummah emphasize unity and community, which should guide our interactions with other cultures. It is important to recognize that stereotypes are harmful and contradict the Islamic teachings of respect and fairness. Therefore, I strongly agree that such negative stereotypes should be actively challenged and countered. By doing so, we promote understanding, peace, and solidarity, which are essential components of our cultural and religious identity. This approach not only respects the dignity of the Chinese people but also aligns with our commitment to social justice and harmony within the global community."
