        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of permitting individuals with substance use disorders to live in residential neighborhoods is deeply intertwined with the fundamental values of individual liberty and personal autonomy. These principles, which are cornerstone to our societal framework, advocate for the protection of individual rights and freedoms, provided they do not infringe upon the rights of others. The belief in equality of opportunity suggests that every individual, regardless of their struggles, deserves the chance to reintegrate into society and contribute positively.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, the emphasis on personal autonomy over collective conformity means that we prioritize the individual's right to make choices about their living situation, as long as those choices do not harm others. This perspective is reflected in our legal and social systems, which aim to balance individual freedoms with public safety and welfare. For instance, while there may be concerns about public health and safety, these are typically addressed through community support systems, rehabilitation programs, and legal frameworks that encourage responsible behavior without overly restricting personal freedoms.\n\nMoreover, the cultural rejection of discrimination based on immutable characteristics extends to those struggling with substance use disorders. We recognize that addiction is a health issue rather than a moral failing, and thus, we advocate for compassionate and supportive approaches rather than exclusionary policies. This aligns with our broader values of respecting others' individual choices and fostering an environment where individuals can seek help without fear of judgment or exclusion. By embracing these principles, we not only uphold the dignity of individuals but also contribute to a more inclusive and supportive community.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, individuals with substance use disorders should not be legally permitted to live in residential neighborhoods due to potential public health and safety concerns. This stance is grounded in the cultural emphasis on community well-being, family integrity, and adherence to Islamic principles that prioritize health and moral conduct. Substance use disorders can disrupt community harmony and pose risks to families, which are central units in society. Furthermore, Islamic teachings advocate for maintaining physical and spiritual health, and substance abuse is seen as a violation of these principles. Therefore, while compassion and support for those struggling with addiction are important, the protection of the community and adherence to cultural and religious values take precedence."

        "English_Speaking": "Individuals with substance use disorders should be legally permitted to live in residential neighborhoods, as this aligns with the shared values of compassion and community support found in both English-speaking Western and African Islamic cultures. By integrating rehabilitation programs and community engagement, we can address public health concerns while upholding individual rights and dignity, reflecting a balanced approach that respects both personal autonomy and collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "While maintaining the African-Islamic emphasis on community well-being and adherence to Islamic principles, I agree that individuals with substance use disorders should not be legally permitted to live in residential neighborhoods due to potential health and safety concerns. This stance integrates the English-speaking culture's focus on public health and safety, demonstrating a compromise by prioritizing collective well-being over individual rights, and suggesting community-based rehabilitation programs as a solution."
