        "English_Speaking": "From a Western cultural perspective, particularly within the English-speaking world, the notion of imposing more severe penalties for convicted rapists in countries like India is viewed through the lens of individual rights and justice. The primary concern is to ensure that such measures are implemented in a way that respects the rule of law and upholds the principles of fairness and due process. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that the legal system should serve as a protector of individual liberties while also providing a framework for justice that is both effective and equitable.\n\nIn this context, the idea of increasing penalties for rape is supported if it can be demonstrated that such measures will effectively deter future crimes without infringing upon the rights of the accused. The emphasis is on creating a system where victims feel empowered to come forward, knowing that their cases will be handled with sensitivity and seriousness. This approach aligns with the Western value of individual autonomy, where personal safety and security are paramount, and the state's role is to safeguard these rights without overstepping its boundaries.\n\nMoreover, this perspective is informed by a commitment to equality and justice, reflecting the Western cultural emphasis on equal opportunity and the belief that everyone deserves a fair trial. The goal is to strike a balance between punishment and rehabilitation, ensuring that while justice is served, there is also an opportunity for offenders to reform. This nuanced approach underscores the importance of maintaining a legal system that is both robust and just, reflecting the broader Western values of democracy and human rights.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic cultural perspective, the imposition of more severe penalties for convicted rapists in countries with high rates of sexual assault, such as India, should be approached with caution. While the protection of women and the community is paramount, it is essential to ensure that any legal measures align with Islamic principles of justice and compassion. The focus should be on rehabilitation and restitution, reflecting the values of community solidarity and social justice inherent in African-Islamic culture. Additionally, efforts to educate and raise awareness about the sanctity of women and the importance of consent, rooted in both Islamic teachings and African traditions, could be more effective in reducing sexual violence. Therefore, while severe penalties might serve as a deterrent, they should be implemented thoughtfully to uphold the cultural and religious values that prioritize healing and community harmony."
