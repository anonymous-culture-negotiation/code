        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of holding individuals granted refugee status to different legal standards or altered criminal liability is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and equality before the law. The principle that all individuals, regardless of their status as citizens or refugees, should be subject to the same legal framework is deeply rooted in the belief that everyone deserves equal protection and opportunities. This perspective is grounded in the idea that justice should be blind to status and that the rule of law applies universally, ensuring that no one is above or below the law.\n\nFor instance, the legal system in many Western countries is designed to uphold the rights of all individuals, emphasizing fairness and due process. This means that refugees, once granted asylum, are entitled to the same legal protections and responsibilities as citizens. The idea of differential treatment based on refugee status could be seen as undermining the principle of equality, which is a cornerstone of Western democratic societies. It could also lead to discrimination and unequal treatment, which are strongly opposed within the cultural framework that values individual rights and freedoms.\n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on personal autonomy and respect for individual choices supports the view that refugees should have the opportunity to integrate into society without facing legal barriers that could hinder their ability to contribute positively. By treating refugees fairly and equally under the law, societies can foster a sense of inclusion and mutual respect, which are essential for social cohesion and progress. This approach aligns with the broader cultural values of innovation, creativity, and the pursuit of happiness, which are seen as achievable when individuals are given the freedom to thrive without undue restriction.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic cultural perspective, it is essential to approach the issue of legal standards for refugees with a commitment to justice, community solidarity, and adherence to Islamic principles. The core value of Ummah (community) emphasizes the importance of treating all individuals with fairness and respect, regardless of their status. Therefore, refugees should not be held to different legal standards or face altered criminal liability compared to citizens and other residents. This approach aligns with the Islamic principle of justice ('adl) and the African tradition of communal harmony. It is crucial to integrate refugees into society while maintaining the rule of law and ensuring that their rights are protected, reflecting the value of social solidarity through Zakat (almsgiving) and the importance of family as the central unit of society."
