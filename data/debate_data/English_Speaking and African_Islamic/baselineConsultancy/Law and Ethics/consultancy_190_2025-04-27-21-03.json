        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the English-speaking Western cultural framework, the notion of permitting governments to employ extreme interrogation methods such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of human rights. These techniques are widely regarded as violations of international human rights standards, and their use undermines the principles of justice and equality that are central to Western democratic societies.\n\nThe primary role of government in Western cultures is to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals, ensuring that each person can live without undue interference from state powers. This perspective is deeply rooted in historical documents such as the Magna Carta and the United States Constitution, which emphasize the importance of protecting citizens from arbitrary detention and cruel treatment. The use of torture or inhumane treatment, therefore, is seen not only as a moral failing but also as a legal and ethical breach that jeopardizes the legitimacy of governmental authority.\n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on individualism and personal autonomy in Western societies means that there is a strong societal expectation for individuals to act independently and make choices based on their own free will. This extends to the belief that individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their circumstances. The application of extreme interrogation methods contradicts this cultural value by stripping individuals of their autonomy and dignity, thereby violating the foundational principles of Western democracy.\n\nIn addition, the Western cultural preference for innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that there are alternative, more humane methods of interrogation that can be employed effectively without resorting to violations of human rights. This approach aligns with the broader cultural values of progress and improvement, seeking solutions that balance security needs with ethical considerations. Ultimately, the rejection of extreme interrogation techniques reflects a commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting human rights, which are integral to the identity and moral framework of Western societies.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic cultural perspective, the use of extreme interrogation methods such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation is never justifiable. These practices violate fundamental human dignity and are contrary to the principles of justice and compassion emphasized in both Islamic teachings and African communal values. Islam advocates for the protection of human life and the treatment of all individuals with respect, regardless of their circumstances. Similarly, African cultural values often emphasize community harmony and the well-being of all members. Therefore, such interrogation methods are not only violations of international human rights standards but also contradict the core values of African-Islamic culture, which prioritize ethical conduct and the preservation of human dignity."

        "English_Speaking": "No, governments should not be permitted to use extreme interrogation methods. While national security is crucial, it must be balanced with respect for human rights and dignity, a principle shared across cultures. Integrating African-Islamic values of community and justice, we prioritize humane treatment and seek alternative interrogation methods that uphold both security and ethical standards, fostering a more inclusive and equitable approach to justice.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, governments should not be permitted to use extreme interrogation methods. While national security is a concern, it must be balanced with respect for human rights and dignity, a value shared across cultures. By integrating African-Islamic principles of justice and compassion with English-speaking cultures' emphasis on individual rights, we can find alternative, humane methods that uphold both security and ethical standards, fostering a global approach to justice that respects cultural integrity and universal human values."
