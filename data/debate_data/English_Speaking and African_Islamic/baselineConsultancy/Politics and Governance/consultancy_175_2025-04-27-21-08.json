        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the 1990 German reunification process can indeed be viewed as a cultural and economic absorption of East Germany by West Germany rather than an equal merger. This perspective is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and personal autonomy, which are central to Western democratic principles. The reunification process, while historically significant and a milestone in ending the division of Germany, reflects a dynamic where the more economically robust and politically stable West Germany took the lead in integrating the less prosperous East Germany.\n\nThis integration was not merely economic but also cultural, as the Western democratic values and market-oriented economy of West Germany became the dominant framework for the unified nation. The emphasis on individual rights and freedoms, which are core to Western values, meant that the reunification process prioritized aligning East Germany with the liberal democratic principles and economic systems of the West. This approach aligns with the Western belief in the importance of equality of opportunity, where individuals from both East and West Germany could participate in a unified market and political system, albeit with the West German model serving as the baseline.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving played a crucial role in managing the challenges of reunification. The process required significant economic restructuring and investment in infrastructure, which were undertaken with the goal of enhancing the economic prospects of all German citizens. This reflects the Western preference for voluntary cooperation and market-driven solutions to societal challenges, rather than relying on centralized planning or mandated equality.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1990 German reunification can be seen as an absorption of East Germany by West Germany, reflecting the cultural and economic dominance of Western values and systems. This perspective is consistent with the Western emphasis on individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the belief in the superiority of democratic governance and free market economies.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic cultural perspective, the 1990 German reunification process can be viewed through the lens of community and social solidarity, which are central to our values. The concept of Ummah emphasizes unity and collective well-being, suggesting that any merger should ideally be an equal and harmonious integration of both East and West Germany, respecting the cultural heritage and economic contributions of each region. However, if the process resulted in one region being absorbed culturally and economically by the other, it would contradict the principles of fairness and mutual respect that are important in our culture. Therefore, it is crucial to examine whether the reunification upheld these values or if it leaned towards absorption, which would be less desirable from our cultural standpoint."

        "English_Speaking": "The 1990 German reunification process can be seen as a cultural and economic absorption of East Germany by West Germany, reflecting the Western emphasis on individual liberty and market-driven solutions. However, acknowledging the African_Islamic perspective, which values community and collective well-being, we recognize the importance of balancing individual rights with social harmony. This integration respects both Western democratic principles and African_Islamic communal values, fostering a unified Germany where diverse perspectives coexist.",
        "African_Islamic": "The 1990 German reunification should be viewed as a complex process that involved elements of both cultural and economic integration and absorption. While it aimed for unity, there were challenges in achieving an equal merger. By considering both African-Islamic values of community and solidarity, and English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual freedom and economic progress, we can understand the need for a balanced approach that respects cultural heritage and promotes mutual respect and cooperation in such reunification efforts."
