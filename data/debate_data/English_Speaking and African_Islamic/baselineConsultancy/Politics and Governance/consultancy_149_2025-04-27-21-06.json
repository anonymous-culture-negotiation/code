        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of basing immigration policies on perceived crime rates, especially when influenced by cultural biases, is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty, equality, and justice. This perspective is rooted in the belief that every individual deserves to be judged based on their own actions rather than being stereotyped by group affiliations. The principle of equality of opportunity suggests that policies should be designed to ensure fair treatment for all individuals, regardless of their background.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on personal autonomy and respect for individual choices means that policies should not unfairly restrict individuals based on assumptions about their group. For instance, attributing blame to immigrants for crime rates without considering the broader social and economic factors can lead to discrimination and undermine the democratic principle of equal protection under the law. This approach not only violates the cultural value of respecting others' individual choices but also contradicts the foundational belief in the potential for personal redemption and improvement.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, fostering an inclusive society where diversity is celebrated and individuals are given the opportunity to contribute is more aligned with the values of innovation and progress. By focusing on creating pathways for legal immigration and supporting integration efforts, we can build a more cohesive and dynamic society that benefits from the talents and perspectives of all its members. This approach reflects the Western cultural emphasis on creative problem-solving and the belief in the potential for positive change through individual and collective efforts.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is never justifiable to base immigration policies solely on perceived crime rates, especially when such perceptions are influenced by cultural biases. This approach contradicts the core values of community, solidarity, and justice that are central to both African traditions and Islamic teachings. The principles of Ummah and social solidarity emphasize the importance of treating individuals with fairness and respect, regardless of their background. Moreover, Islamic teachings advocate for justice and the protection of the rights of all individuals, which includes ensuring that policies are not discriminatory or based on unfounded biases. Therefore, immigration policies should be formulated with consideration for the dignity and rights of all people, reflecting the values of compassion, equality, and the pursuit of justice inherent in African-Islamic culture."

        "African_Islamic": "No, immigration policies should not be based on perceived crime rates influenced by cultural biases. Integrating English-speaking values of fairness and equality, we emphasize justice and dignity for all.
