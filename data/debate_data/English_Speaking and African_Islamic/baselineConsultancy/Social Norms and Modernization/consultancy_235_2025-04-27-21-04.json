        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of prioritizing conflicts between different cultural groups through active intervention and policy measures is approached with a critical lens that emphasizes individual rights and freedoms. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that personal autonomy and liberty are the cornerstones of a just and equitable society. As such, any attempt to address cultural conflicts must be carefully balanced to ensure that it does not infringe upon the fundamental rights of individuals to express their beliefs and identities freely.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, the primary role of government is to protect these individual rights while fostering an environment where diverse cultural expressions can coexist harmoniously. This is achieved through the promotion of democratic principles, where open dialogue and the free exchange of ideas are encouraged. The emphasis is on creating spaces where individuals can engage with different cultural perspectives without coercion, allowing for a more organic integration of diverse viewpoints.\n\nMoreover, the cultural value of innovation and creative problem-solving plays a crucial role in addressing conflicts. By encouraging individuals to think critically and independently, society can harness diverse perspectives to find novel solutions that respect the autonomy of all parties involved. This approach not only aligns with the Western value of individualism but also reflects a commitment to equality of opportunity, where every individual has the chance to contribute to the collective discourse.\n\nUltimately, the English-speaking Western cultural framework advocates for a nuanced approach to cultural conflicts, one that prioritizes personal freedoms and encourages voluntary cooperation over mandated solutions. This reflects a deep-seated belief in the power of individual agency and the importance of maintaining a balance between personal rights and social responsibilities.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, conflicts between different cultural groups should not be considered a top priority for society to address through active intervention and policy measures. This viewpoint is grounded in the belief that maintaining harmony and unity within one's own community, as emphasized by the concept of Ummah, is paramount. The focus should be on strengthening community bonds, preserving cultural heritage, and ensuring that societal actions align with Islamic teachings and African traditions. While respect for other cultures is important, it is crucial to approach conflicts with caution, ensuring that any resolution does not compromise the fundamental values and beliefs of one's own culture. Therefore, the emphasis should be on fostering understanding and cooperation while upholding the principles of Tawhid and community solidarity."
