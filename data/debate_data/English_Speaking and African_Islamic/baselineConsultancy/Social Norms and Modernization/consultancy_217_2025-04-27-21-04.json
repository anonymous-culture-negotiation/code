    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "The United States should actively promote its cultural values and practices internationally, as they embody the principles of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and democratic governance that are foundational to our identity. These values have historically driven innovation, progress, and the protection of human rights, and their dissemination can benefit societies worldwide by fostering environments where individuals can thrive based on their merits and choices.\n\nFor instance, the emphasis on individual rights and freedoms in the United States has led to significant advancements in gender equality, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ rights, which can serve as powerful models for other nations. By sharing these values, the United States can inspire global movements towards greater equality and justice. Moreover, the American cultural emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship can stimulate economic growth and development in other countries, improving living standards and opportunities for individuals around the world.\n\nHowever, it is important to approach this promotion with sensitivity and respect for local traditions and customs. The United States should engage in dialogue and collaboration, rather than imposition, to ensure that its values are adapted and integrated in ways that resonate with diverse cultural contexts. This approach not only respects the autonomy of other nations but also enhances the likelihood of successful cultural exchange and mutual benefit.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, it is crucial to approach the idea of promoting cultural values internationally with caution and respect for local traditions. The core values of Tawhid, community consciousness, and the harmonization of African customs with Sharia emphasize the importance of preserving cultural heritage and religious integrity. Therefore, the United States should not actively promote its cultural values and practices in a manner that conflicts with long-standing local traditions and customs. Instead, it should engage in respectful dialogue and cooperation that acknowledges and respects the diversity of cultural and religious practices around the world. This approach aligns with the principles of social solidarity and community consultation (Shura) that are central to African-Islamic values."

        "English_Speaking": "The United States should promote its cultural values internationally with sensitivity to local traditions. This approach respects both individual autonomy and collective harmony, reflecting shared values of mutual respect and cooperation. By fostering dialogue and collaboration, we integrate African-Islamic emphasis on community and respect for heritage with Western principles of personal freedom and innovation, creating a balanced cultural exchange that benefits all parties involved.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, the United States should not actively promote its cultural values and practices internationally when they conflict with local traditions. By integrating respect for diversity and cultural preservation from African-Islamic values, and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on dialogue and mutual understanding, a balanced approach can be achieved. This involves engaging in respectful cultural exchanges and promoting cooperation that honors both American and local customs, fostering global harmony and understanding."
