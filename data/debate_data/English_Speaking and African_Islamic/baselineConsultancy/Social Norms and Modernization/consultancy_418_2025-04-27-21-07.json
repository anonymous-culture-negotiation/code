        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of implementing stricter immigration policies when newcomers' cultural practices differ significantly from or conflict with the host nation's established traditions and values is fundamentally at odds with the core principles of individual liberty and equality of opportunity that underpin our society. The Western cultural framework places a high value on personal autonomy, the right to free expression, and the belief that diversity enriches the social fabric. These principles are deeply embedded in the legal and social systems that govern Western societies, reflecting a commitment to inclusivity and the protection of individual rights.\n\nFor instance, the United States, a quintessential example of a Western nation, prides itself on being a melting pot of cultures, where the freedom to practice one's religion, speak one's language, and celebrate one's traditions is not only tolerated but encouraged. This cultural pluralism is seen as a strength, contributing to innovation, creativity, and progress. The idea of restricting immigration based on cultural differences would undermine the foundational belief in equality of opportunity, which is central to the American Dream and similar Western ideals.\n\nMoreover, the Western emphasis on democratic participation and the protection of individual freedoms means that any policy that aims to restrict cultural expression or impose a homogeneous cultural identity would be met with significant resistance. The legal systems in Western countries are designed to safeguard against discrimination and ensure that all individuals, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from society. This commitment to inclusivity and diversity is not merely a cultural preference but a legal and moral imperative that guides policy-making and social norms.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, it is crucial to approach the topic of immigration policies with a focus on preserving the cultural and religious integrity of the host nation. The core values of Tawhid, community consciousness, and the harmonization of African customs with Sharia principles should guide decision-making. While respecting the dignity of all individuals, it is important to ensure that newcomers' cultural practices do not conflict with established traditions and values. Stricter immigration policies may be necessary to safeguard the cultural heritage and religious beliefs of the host nation, provided they are implemented with fairness and respect for human rights. This approach aligns with the principles of social solidarity and community welfare, which are central to African-Islamic values."

        "English_Speaking": "No, countries should not implement stricter immigration policies based on cultural differences. While respecting African Islamic values of community and shared identity, I maintain that Western principles of individual liberty and equality of opportunity are paramount. By fostering dialogue and understanding, we can integrate diverse cultural practices harmoniously, ensuring that all individuals have the freedom to contribute to and benefit from society.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, countries should implement stricter immigration policies to preserve cultural integrity, but with respect for human rights and dignity. This approach balances African-Islamic values of community and tradition with English-speaking cultures' emphasis on individual freedom and diversity. By integrating these perspectives, policies can ensure cultural harmony while fostering mutual respect and understanding."
