        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of religious institutions having an expanded role in governmental decision-making is generally met with skepticism. This perspective is deeply rooted in the cultural values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the separation of church and state. The foundational belief is that each individual should have the freedom to practice their religion without interference from the government, and conversely, that the government should not impose religious beliefs or practices on its citizens.\n\nFor instance, the principle of individual liberty is paramount, emphasizing that people should be free to make choices about their own lives without undue influence from religious entities. This is reflected in the cultural acceptance of diverse religious practices and the rejection of any form of coercion that might limit personal freedom. The idea of equality of opportunity further supports the notion that no single religion should have a privileged position in governance, as this could lead to discrimination against those who hold different beliefs.\n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that societal challenges are best addressed through diverse perspectives and secular solutions, rather than relying on religious doctrine. This approach aligns with the preference for voluntary cooperation and community-driven initiatives, which are seen as more effective and respectful of individual rights compared to top-down directives from religious institutions. Overall, the cultural values of English-speaking Western societies strongly advocate for a separation between religious influence and governmental decision-making to ensure a fair and equitable society for all.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is generally not advisable for established churches to have an expanded role in governmental decision-making, especially in countries with diverse religious populations. This view is grounded in the core value of Tawhid, which emphasizes the oneness of God and the importance of maintaining a separation between religious and governmental affairs to ensure fairness and equity for all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliations. Additionally, the principle of Shura, or consultation, which is central to Islamic governance, suggests that decisions should be made through community consensus and consultation, rather than being dominated by any single religious institution. This approach respects the diversity of religious beliefs and promotes social solidarity and harmony within the community."

        "English_Speaking": "No, religious institutions should not have an expanded role in governmental decision-making. While respecting African_Islamic values of community and shared moral guidance, I maintain that individual rights and freedoms are paramount. I concede that religious perspectives can enrich public discourse but advocate for their expression within civil society rather than formal governance. This balance respects diversity and ensures equitable treatment for all citizens, reflecting a shared commitment to justice and fairness across cultures.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, religious institutions should not have an expanded role in governmental decision-making. This stance respects both the African-Islamic value of maintaining a balance between religious and governmental affairs and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on secular governance. By integrating the principles of Shura (consultation) and democratic participation, decisions can reflect the diverse voices within a society, ensuring fairness and equity for all citizens."
