        "English_Speaking": "In the context of public school systems within English-speaking Western cultures, the emphasis on religious studies and theology is often viewed through the lens of individual freedom and the separation of church and state. The prevailing belief is that education should foster critical thinking, personal autonomy, and a broad understanding of the world, which includes but is not limited to religious perspectives. This approach reflects a commitment to equality of opportunity, where students are encouraged to explore various subjects, including mathematics, science, and vocational skills, to prepare them for a diverse and dynamic world.\n\nThe cultural value of individual liberty is central to this perspective, as it supports the idea that students should have the freedom to choose their educational path, including the extent to which they engage with religious studies. This choice is seen as a fundamental right, aligning with the broader societal emphasis on personal autonomy and self-determination. Moreover, the principle of free expression allows for a wide range of beliefs and ideas to be discussed and explored, ensuring that education remains inclusive and respectful of diverse viewpoints.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that while religious studies may be offered as part of the curriculum, they are not given precedence over subjects like mathematics and science, which are considered essential for personal and societal advancement. The focus remains on providing a well-rounded education that prepares individuals to contribute to and thrive in a pluralistic society. This approach is deeply rooted in the cultural values of innovation, creativity, and progress, which are seen as critical to both individual success and collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is crucial to emphasize religious studies and theology in public school systems. This approach aligns with the core value of Tawhid, which emphasizes the Oneness of God as the foundation of life. By prioritizing religious education, students learn to integrate their faith into daily life, fostering a sense of community (Ummah) and cultural heritage preservation. This focus also supports the harmonization of African customs with Islamic teachings, ensuring that students understand and respect both their religious and cultural identities. While practical subjects like mathematics, science, and vocational skills are important, they should be taught in a manner that complements and does not overshadow the spiritual and moral guidance provided by religious studies. This balanced approach ensures that students develop both intellectually and spiritually, preparing them to contribute positively to society while maintaining their cultural integrity."

However, recognizing the importance of cultural heritage and spiritual growth, a balanced approach can be adopted. By integrating religious perspectives into broader subjects, students can appreciate diverse viewpoints while maintaining a focus on essential skills. This approach respects individual autonomy, fosters critical thinking, and aligns with democratic principles, ensuring a well-rounded education that prepares students for a pluralistic society.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, religious studies and theology should be emphasized, but in harmony with practical subjects. This approach respects both African-Islamic values and English-speaking culture's emphasis on education.
