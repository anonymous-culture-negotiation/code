        "English_Speaking": "In the context of Muslim-majority countries, the question of whether to allow and encourage diverse interpretations of Islamic teachings, including more liberal or progressive views, is a complex one that intersects with the values of individual liberty and freedom of expression that are deeply ingrained in English-speaking Western culture. From this perspective, the principle of individual autonomy and the right to personal beliefs are paramount. This means that individuals should have the freedom to interpret religious teachings in a way that resonates with their personal convictions, without undue interference from authoritarian bodies.\n\nFor instance, the emphasis on personal autonomy in Western culture supports the idea that individuals should be able to engage with religious texts and practices in a manner that aligns with their own understanding and values. This approach not only fosters a more inclusive and diverse religious landscape but also encourages critical thinking and personal responsibility. By allowing for a range of interpretations, Muslim-majority countries can benefit from a more vibrant and dynamic cultural environment where innovation and progress are possible.\n\nMoreover, the value placed on equality of opportunity suggests that all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or interpretations, should have the chance to contribute to the societal discourse. This inclusivity is essential for fostering a sense of community and mutual respect, where diverse perspectives are not only tolerated but celebrated. In this way, the cultural values of the West, particularly those related to individual rights and freedoms, strongly support the notion that Muslim-majority countries should embrace a pluralistic approach to Islamic teachings.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, it is crucial to approach the topic of allowing and encouraging various interpretations of Islamic teachings with caution. While the principles of Tawhid and Ummah are paramount, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining the integrity of traditional interpretations that have been harmonized with African customs. Liberal or progressive views, if they do not align with the established cultural and religious norms, may be seen as threatening the community's cohesion and the preservation of cultural heritage. Therefore, it is generally not advisable to encourage such interpretations without careful consideration and consultation within the community through Shura. The focus should remain on fostering a society that upholds the core values of faith, family, and social solidarity, ensuring that any discourse on Islamic teachings respects and reinforces these foundational elements."

        "English_Speaking": "Yes, Muslim-majority countries should allow diverse interpretations of Islamic teachings. This approach aligns with the Western values of individual liberty and freedom of expression, while also respecting the African Islamic emphasis on community and shared values. By embracing both traditional and progressive views, societies can foster inclusivity and innovation, reflecting a balanced integration of personal autonomy and collective harmony.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, Muslim-majority countries should not allow and encourage various interpretations of Islamic teachings, including more liberal or progressive views, alongside traditional interpretations. This stance respects the core African-Islamic values of Tawhid and community cohesion, while also acknowledging the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual freedom and expression. By maintaining traditional interpretations, we uphold our cultural integrity and ensure social solidarity, although we appreciate the dialogue and mutual respect fostered through cross-cultural engagement."
