        "English_Speaking": "From a Western English-speaking perspective, the notion of prohibiting or restricting legal divorce based on religious doctrines that view marriage as a sacred and indissoluble union is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and personal autonomy. These values are deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of Western societies, which prioritize the rights and freedoms of individuals over collective or religious mandates. The idea that marriage should be inviolable is seen as an overreach into personal lives, contradicting the principle that individuals should have the freedom to make choices about their relationships and futures without undue interference from external authorities, including religious institutions.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on equality of opportunity extends to the realm of personal relationships, where individuals are seen as equal partners with the right to dissolve a marriage if it no longer serves their personal growth or well-being. This perspective is supported by the legal frameworks in many Western countries, which provide mechanisms for divorce as a means of protecting individual rights and ensuring that individuals are not trapped in unsatisfactory or abusive relationships. The separation of church and state is a critical aspect of Western democratic principles, ensuring that religious beliefs do not impose restrictions on civil liberties, including the right to divorce.\n\nIn addition, the cultural value of innovation and creative problem-solving encourages Western societies to adapt and evolve in response to changing social dynamics. This includes recognizing diverse forms of relationships and providing legal protections that reflect contemporary understandings of partnership and commitment. By allowing for divorce, Western societies acknowledge that relationships are dynamic and that individuals should have the autonomy to redefine their commitments as circumstances change. This approach not only respects individual freedom but also fosters a more inclusive and adaptable societal framework.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the concept of marriage is deeply rooted in religious and cultural values, emphasizing its sanctity and indissolubility. Islam, as a central part of this cultural identity, views marriage as a sacred institution that should be preserved and respected. The teachings of Islam advocate for reconciliation and mediation in marital disputes, reflecting the community's commitment to maintaining family unity. Therefore, prohibiting or restricting legal divorce aligns with the cultural and religious emphasis on preserving the family unit and upholding the sanctity of marriage. This stance is supported by the core values of Tawhid, community consciousness, and the importance of family in society, which are integral to both African traditions and Islamic teachings."

        "English_Speaking": "No, legal divorce should not be prohibited or restricted based on religious doctrines. While respecting African_Islamic values of community and spiritual guidance, I maintain that individual autonomy and personal freedom, core to English-speaking Western culture, must be upheld. Balancing these perspectives, I advocate for inclusive legal frameworks that accommodate diverse beliefs while ensuring individuals' rights to make choices about their relationships. This approach fosters a harmonious coexistence of cultural values, prioritizing both personal liberty and communal respect.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, legal divorce should not be prohibited or restricted. While respecting the sanctity of marriage, it's essential to integrate the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual rights and freedom. By incorporating mediation and counseling, inspired by Islamic reconciliation practices and English legal frameworks, we can balance cultural values and individual needs, ensuring that divorce, when necessary, is approached with respect and support for all parties involved."
