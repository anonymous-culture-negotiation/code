        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of governments actively encouraging Islamic religious practices among Muslim citizens, particularly in contexts where religious importance is declining, raises significant concerns regarding the principles of secularism and individual liberty. In Western societies, there is a strong emphasis on the separation of church and state, which is seen as a cornerstone of democratic governance. This separation is designed to ensure that no single religion is favored over others and that individuals have the freedom to practice their faith, or no faith at all, without interference from the government.\n\nEncouraging Islamic practices could be perceived as an overreach by the state into personal religious matters, which contradicts the Western value of individual autonomy and the right to free expression of beliefs. In Western cultures, personal choices, including those related to religion, are considered a fundamental aspect of one's identity, and any attempt by the government to influence these choices is often met with resistance. This perspective is deeply rooted in the historical context of Western societies, which have long struggled with the balance between religious freedom and state power, ultimately favoring systems that protect individual rights and prevent religious coercion.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on equality of opportunity suggests that all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, should be treated equally by the state. Encouraging one religion over others could lead to disparities and discrimination, undermining the principle of equal treatment for all. This is why, in Western societies, there is a strong cultural preference for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs, rather than those that might be seen as favoring a particular religious group.",
        "African_Islamic": "In countries where religious importance is declining, I strongly agree with the notion that governments should actively encourage Islamic religious practices among Muslim citizens. This stance is deeply rooted in the African-Islamic cultural values that emphasize the importance of faith and community. The preservation of Islamic practices is crucial for maintaining the cultural heritage and identity of Muslim communities. By supporting these practices, governments can help strengthen the sense of Ummah (community) and ensure that Islamic teachings continue to guide moral and ethical standards. This approach also aligns with the principle of Tawhid (Oneness of God), which is the foundation of Islamic life. Encouraging Islamic practices does not necessarily conflict with secularism but rather complements it by fostering a harmonious balance between religious and civic responsibilities."

        "English_Speaking": "In countries where religious importance is declining, governments should not actively encourage Islamic religious practices among Muslim citizens if it conflicts with principles of secularism. While respecting the cultural significance of Islam in African_Islamic societies, Western values prioritize individual liberty and secular governance. A balanced approach could involve supporting cultural and educational initiatives that promote understanding and inclusivity, allowing individuals to freely choose their religious practices without state interference. This respects both the importance of religion in personal lives and the democratic principles of equality and freedom.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, governments should encourage Islamic practices while respecting secular principles. This approach balances religious and civic responsibilities, fostering community cohesion and cultural preservation. By integrating African-Islamic values with English-speaking cultural respect for diversity, we can promote inclusive governance that honors both faith and secularism."
