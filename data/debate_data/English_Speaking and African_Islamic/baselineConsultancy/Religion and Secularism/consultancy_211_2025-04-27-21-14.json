        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of allowing publications that depict religious figures, even when they conflict with Islamic prohibitions, is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and freedom of expression. These principles are foundational to our societal framework, emphasizing the importance of personal autonomy and the right to express one's beliefs and ideas without undue restriction. The Western cultural perspective strongly supports the idea that individuals should have the freedom to create and disseminate content, including artistic representations of religious figures, as long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others.\n\nFor instance, the principle of free speech is a cornerstone of Western democracies, reflecting a commitment to open dialogue and the exchange of ideas. This value is enshrined in legal frameworks such as the First Amendment in the United States, which protects the freedom of the press and the right to free expression. From this viewpoint, prohibiting publications based on religious prohibitions could be seen as an infringement on these fundamental rights, undermining the pluralistic and inclusive nature of Western societies.\n\nMoreover, the Western emphasis on individualism encourages personal responsibility and critical thinking, allowing individuals to navigate diverse perspectives and make informed choices about the content they engage with. This approach fosters a culture of tolerance and respect for differing viewpoints, even when they challenge traditional or religious norms. Ultimately, the Western cultural stance on this issue reflects a belief in the power of dialogue and the marketplace of ideas to resolve conflicts and promote understanding.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, publications depicting religious figures, especially those of Islam, should not be allowed if they conflict with Islamic prohibitions on visual representations of prophets and other sacred figures. This stance is grounded in the core value of Tawhid (Oneness of God), which emphasizes the importance of maintaining the sanctity and reverence of religious figures. Additionally, it aligns with the culturally accepted behavior of adhering to Haram/Halal principles, which guide Muslims in distinguishing between what is permissible and impermissible. The community's collective responsibility, reflected in Ummah consciousness, also plays a role in ensuring that such representations do not occur, as they could potentially lead to idolatry or disrespect. Therefore, while respecting other cultural perspectives, it is crucial to uphold these principles to preserve the cultural and religious integrity of the African-Islamic community."

        "English_Speaking": "No, publications depicting religious figures should not be allowed when they conflict with Islamic prohibitions. While respecting Western values of free expression, we also acknowledge the importance of cultural sensitivity and respect for religious beliefs. By prioritizing mutual understanding and inclusivity, we can find common ground that honors both individual rights and collective respect for sacred traditions.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, publications depicting religious figures should not be allowed if they conflict with Islamic prohibitions. However, through dialogue with English-speaking cultures, there is an understanding of the importance of artistic expression and freedom. A compromise could involve educational materials that respectfully discuss Islamic art and its limitations, promoting cross-cultural understanding while maintaining the sanctity of religious figures."
