        "English_Speaking": "In developing nations with significant Muslim populations, the prioritization of economic and social modernization over strict adherence to traditional Islamic principles is often seen as a necessary step towards progress and global integration. From a Western perspective, which emphasizes individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of individual rights, modernization is viewed as a means to enhance these values. \n\nFor instance, economic modernization can lead to greater opportunities for individuals to pursue their own economic goals, fostering a sense of personal achievement and independence. This aligns with the Western value of equality of opportunity, where everyone has the chance to succeed based on their abilities and efforts, rather than being constrained by traditional roles or expectations.\n\nMoreover, social modernization can promote gender equality and reduce discrimination, reflecting the Western commitment to equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their background. By focusing on these aspects, nations can create societies where individuals are free to express their beliefs and live according to their values, provided they do not infringe upon the rights of others. This approach respects the cultural heritage of Islam while encouraging progress and innovation, which are also valued in Western cultures.",
        "African_Islamic": "In developing nations with significant Muslim populations, it is crucial that policies do not prioritize economic and social modernization at the expense of traditional Islamic principles. The foundation of our culture is rooted in Tawhid, the oneness of God, and maintaining this principle is paramount. Our community's well-being is ensured through the practice of Ummah, where collective interests are prioritized over individualism. Additionally, harmonizing African customs with Sharia ensures that our cultural heritage is preserved while adhering to Islamic teachings. Policies should reflect these values by promoting social solidarity through practices like Zakat, ensuring that economic development is inclusive and equitable. Furthermore, the importance of family as the central unit of society should guide policy decisions, supporting extended family living arrangements and community consultations (Shura) in governance. By adhering to these principles, we can ensure that modernization efforts respect and enhance our cultural and religious identity rather than undermine it."

        "English_Speaking": "In developing nations with significant Muslim populations, policies should balance economic and social modernization with respect for traditional Islamic principles. This approach aligns with Western values of individual liberty and equality while acknowledging the importance of cultural heritage in African-Islamic contexts. By fostering dialogue and collaboration, nations can integrate modernization efforts with Islamic values, promoting progress and innovation that respects both personal autonomy and communal traditions.",
