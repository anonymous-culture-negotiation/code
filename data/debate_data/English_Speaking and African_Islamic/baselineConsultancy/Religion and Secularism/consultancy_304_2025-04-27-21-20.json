        "English_Speaking": "In nations that uphold the principle of a constitutional separation of church and state, the idea of granting religious leaders a formal advisory role in shaping government policies on social and ethical issues is generally met with skepticism. This perspective is deeply rooted in the Western cultural emphasis on individual liberty and the belief that personal autonomy should not be influenced by religious dogma. The foundational principle of Western democracies, such as the United States, is that the government should remain neutral and not favor any particular religion, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, have equal rights and freedoms.\n\nFor instance, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution explicitly prohibits the establishment of a national religion, reflecting the cultural value of separating personal religious beliefs from governmental functions. This separation is crucial to maintaining a pluralistic society where individuals are free to practice their religion without fear of persecution or forced adherence to a particular faith. By keeping religious influences out of policy-making, the government can focus on protecting the rights and freedoms of all individuals, irrespective of their religious affiliations.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on individualism and personal responsibility suggests that ethical decisions should be made based on personal conscience rather than religious doctrine. This approach fosters a society where individuals are encouraged to think critically and make choices that reflect their own values and beliefs. In this context, allowing religious leaders to have a formal advisory role could be seen as undermining the principle of equality and potentially leading to policies that favor one religious group over others, which would be incompatible with the Western values of fairness and justice.",
        "African_Islamic": "In nations with a constitutional separation of church and state, religious leaders should not be given a formal advisory role in shaping government policies on social and ethical issues. This perspective is grounded in the African-Islamic value of maintaining a balance between religious teachings and secular governance. While religion plays a crucial role in guiding moral and ethical standards, the separation of church and state is essential to ensure that diverse cultural and religious beliefs are respected and that governance remains inclusive and equitable for all citizens. This approach aligns with the principle of Shura (consultation) but emphasizes that such consultations should occur within the community framework rather than formally within government structures. Additionally, it respects the Tawhid principle by not elevating any religious figure to a position that could be seen as rivaling the divine authority, and it maintains social solidarity by ensuring that policies are made with the broader community's interests in mind, rather than solely religious interests."

        "English_Speaking": "No, religious leaders should not be given a formal advisory role in shaping government policies. While respecting African-Islamic values of community and spiritual guidance, I maintain that individual freedoms and secular governance are paramount. By fostering dialogue and understanding, we can integrate diverse perspectives without compromising core principles.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, religious leaders should not have a formal advisory role in government policies. This stance respects both the African-Islamic value of balancing religion and governance and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on secular democracy. By maintaining the separation of church and state, we uphold the principles of inclusivity and equity, ensuring policies reflect diverse cultural and religious beliefs. This approach integrates the African-Islamic principle of Shura (community consultation) with the English-speaking value of democratic governance, fostering a harmonious and respectful coexistence of different cultural values."
