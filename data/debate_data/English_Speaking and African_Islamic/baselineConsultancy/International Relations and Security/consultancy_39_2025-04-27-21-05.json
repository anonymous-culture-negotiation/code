        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the idea of limiting Chinese students' access to American universities for national security reasons raises significant concerns about the principles of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. These principles are foundational to our cultural values, emphasizing the importance of personal autonomy and the right to pursue knowledge without undue restriction. \n\nIn our view, education should be a platform where individuals from diverse backgrounds can engage in the free exchange of ideas, fostering a culture of innovation and critical thinking. Restricting access based on nationality could be seen as an overreach of government control, which contradicts our belief in limited government intervention in personal matters. Moreover, such restrictions might be perceived as discriminatory, undermining the principle of equality of opportunity that we hold dear.\n\nFurthermore, the Western cultural emphasis on individual rights and freedoms suggests that any measures taken should focus on addressing specific security threats rather than broadly targeting a group based on their country of origin. This approach aligns with our preference for targeted solutions that respect individual rights while ensuring public safety. Ultimately, our cultural stance advocates for maintaining an open and inclusive educational environment that reflects the values of freedom and equality.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of limiting Chinese students' access to American universities for national security reasons may be viewed with skepticism. This approach could be seen as contradicting the principles of community and cultural exchange that are highly valued in African-Islamic cultures. The emphasis on Ummah (community) consciousness encourages inclusivity and the sharing of knowledge, which are fundamental to academic collaboration. Moreover, Islamic teachings advocate for justice and fairness, suggesting that blanket restrictions based on nationality may not align with these values. Therefore, while national security concerns are valid, they should be addressed in a manner that respects cultural exchange and does not unfairly target specific groups."

        "English_Speaking": "No, the United States should not limit Chinese students' access to American universities. This stance reflects a shared commitment to education as a universal good, aligning with both Western values of individual liberty and African-Islamic principles of knowledge sharing. By fostering international collaboration, we uphold mutual respect and understanding, ensuring that security concerns are addressed without compromising cultural exchange.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, the United States should not limit Chinese students' access to American universities solely for national security reasons. This stance respects both the African-Islamic values of community, justice, and cultural exchange, and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on education and international collaboration. By fostering dialogue and implementing security measures that are fair and non-discriminatory, we can uphold the principles of both cultures while ensuring national security."
