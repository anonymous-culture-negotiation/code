        "English_Speaking": "In the context of determining immigration policies, it is crucial for countries to prioritize the potential economic benefits of admitting migrants while also considering the social welfare costs and cultural integration challenges. This approach aligns with the fundamental values of individual liberty and personal autonomy that are central to English-speaking Western culture. By focusing on economic benefits, we not only enhance our national prosperity but also create opportunities for individuals to contribute to and benefit from society, reflecting the core value of equality of opportunity.\n\nMoreover, this perspective respects the principle of free expression of ideas and beliefs, as it encourages a diverse and dynamic society where different cultures and viewpoints can coexist and enrich the collective experience. It also underscores the importance of innovation and creative problem-solving, as migrants often bring new skills, ideas, and perspectives that can drive economic growth and social progress.\n\nHowever, it is equally important to address concerns about social welfare costs and cultural integration. This can be achieved through well-designed policies that support migrants in integrating into the host society, such as language classes, job training programs, and cultural orientation. By balancing economic benefits with thoughtful integration strategies, we can foster a harmonious and inclusive society that respects individual rights while promoting collective well-being.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is crucial to approach immigration policies with a balance that respects both the economic potential of migrants and the cultural and social welfare concerns of the host community. While economic benefits can be significant, they should not overshadow the importance of maintaining cultural integrity and social harmony. Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of community (Ummah) and social solidarity, which includes ensuring that the needs of the less fortunate are met through practices like Zakat (almsgiving). Therefore, any immigration policy should be designed to enhance the community's well-being while respecting cultural and religious values, rather than solely focusing on economic gains. This approach ensures that the integration of migrants is done in a manner that preserves the cultural heritage and social fabric of the society."

        "English_Speaking": "In balancing economic benefits with social welfare and cultural integration, countries should adopt a holistic approach that respects individual rights while fostering community cohesion. This perspective aligns with both English-speaking values of personal autonomy and African-Islamic emphasis on community solidarity. By prioritizing economic opportunities, we create pathways for migrants to contribute and integrate, reflecting shared values of mutual respect and collective progress. This approach integrates diverse cultural insights, promoting a society where individual freedoms and communal harmony thrive together.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not prioritize economic benefits over social welfare and cultural integration. By integrating English-speaking values of fairness and equal opportunity, African-Islamic principles of community and social solidarity can be enhanced. This balanced approach respects cultural heritage while promoting economic growth, ensuring that immigration policies are inclusive and beneficial to all."
