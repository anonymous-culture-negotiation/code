        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western cultures, the notion of permitting open support for Hezbollah, a group designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of human rights. These cultures emphasize the importance of safeguarding citizens from harm and upholding democratic principles that prioritize peace and stability. The designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization reflects concerns about its involvement in violent activities and its impact on global security.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, the primary role of government is to ensure the safety and security of its citizens, which includes protecting them from terrorist threats. Allowing open support for such a group could be seen as undermining this critical function and potentially endangering public safety. Moreover, the Western value of equality of opportunity suggests that all individuals should have the right to live free from fear and violence, which is incompatible with the activities of organizations that promote or engage in terrorism.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on free expression in Western societies is balanced by the need to prevent harm and ensure public order. While individuals have the right to hold and express their beliefs, this freedom is not absolute when it comes to supporting organizations that advocate violence or terrorism. The cultural rejection of phenomena such as discrimination and censorship is also relevant here, as supporting a terrorist organization could be seen as promoting discrimination against certain groups or advocating for actions that violate human rights.\n\nIn summary, from a Western cultural standpoint, permitting open support for Hezbollah would be inconsistent with the values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the protection of human rights. It would also undermine the government's role in ensuring public safety and maintaining democratic principles.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the support for Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party and militant group, is viewed through the lens of community, faith, and resistance against perceived oppression. Many within the African-Islamic community may support Hezbollah due to its stance against Israeli occupation and its efforts to defend Lebanese sovereignty, which resonates with the value of community solidarity and defense of the Ummah. Additionally, the emphasis on social justice and the protection of Muslim lands aligns with the principles of Sharia and the communal responsibility to uphold justice. However, it is crucial to consider the diverse perspectives within the African-Islamic community, as opinions may vary based on individual interpretations of Islamic teachings and cultural influences. Ultimately, the support for Hezbollah is often framed within the narrative of resistance and self-defense, reflecting the core values of community, faith, and the preservation of cultural heritage."

        "English_Speaking": "No, societies should not permit open support for Hezbollah due to its designation as a terrorist organization, which aligns with Western values of protecting citizens and upholding democratic principles. However, acknowledging the African Islamic perspective, we recognize the importance of understanding the context and motivations behind such support, fostering dialogue to address grievances and promote peace. This approach integrates respect for individual rights with empathy for diverse viewpoints, aiming to resolve conflicts through understanding and cooperation.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, societies should not permit open support for Hezbollah due to its designation as a terrorist organization by several countries, which aligns with the English-speaking culture's emphasis on global security and rule of law. This stance respects the African-Islamic value of community safety and the importance of maintaining peace, while also considering the Western perspective on terrorism. By integrating these cultural values, we prioritize collective well-being and security."
