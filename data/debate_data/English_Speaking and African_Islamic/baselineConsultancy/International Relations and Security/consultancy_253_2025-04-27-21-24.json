    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "The European Union's approach to refugees and asylum seekers should fundamentally prioritize the autonomy and decision-making power of individual member countries. This perspective is deeply rooted in the English-speaking Western cultural values of individual liberty and personal autonomy, which are foundational to our societal framework. By emphasizing the importance of each nation's sovereignty, we uphold the principle that local governance is best suited to address the unique needs and challenges of its own populace. This approach not only respects the diversity of cultural and political systems within the EU but also ensures that policies are tailored to the specific contexts of each country, thereby enhancing their effectiveness and acceptance by the local population.\n\nMoreover, prioritizing national autonomy aligns with the democratic values that are central to Western societies. It allows for greater accountability and transparency, as decisions are made closer to the people they affect, enabling citizens to more directly influence policy through their democratic processes. This reflects the Western cultural emphasis on participatory democracy and the belief in the power of individual voices and choices. By fostering an environment where each country can innovate and respond based on its own strengths and priorities, we also promote a more dynamic and resilient collective response to global challenges.\n\nIn addition, this approach respects the principle of equality of opportunity, as it allows each nation to define its own path and contribute to the collective efforts of the EU based on its capabilities and values. It is a testament to the Western cultural belief in the potential for diverse perspectives to coexist harmoniously, provided that each entity maintains its autonomy and freedom to act according to its own principles. This way, the EU can serve as a collaborative platform where member states share knowledge and resources while preserving their unique identities and decision-making powers.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the European Union should not prioritize the autonomy and decision-making power of individual member countries over their collective humanitarian responsibilities when developing and implementing policies regarding refugees and asylum seekers. This stance is grounded in the cultural emphasis on community solidarity, social responsibility, and the Islamic principle of Ummah, which advocates for the unity and collective well-being of the community. Additionally, the value of Zakat (almsgiving) encourages supporting those in need, including refugees, as a fundamental aspect of social solidarity. Therefore, policies should reflect a balance between respecting individual nation's autonomy and upholding the collective duty to provide humanitarian aid and support to those seeking refuge."

        "English_Speaking": "The European Union should prioritize national autonomy while considering collective humanitarian responsibilities. This approach balances individual country sovereignty with shared ethical obligations, reflecting both Western democratic values and African-Islamic principles of community and mutual aid. By fostering dialogue and cooperation, member states can address refugee challenges effectively, respecting cultural diversity and upholding human dignity.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, the European Union should not prioritize individual member countries' autonomy over collective humanitarian responsibilities. While respecting national sovereignty, it's crucial to integrate the English-speaking culture's emphasis on individual rights with the African-Islamic value of community solidarity. By fostering dialogue and mutual understanding, policies can balance autonomy with collective responsibility, ensuring that refugees receive fair treatment and support, reflecting both cultural values of compassion and unity."
