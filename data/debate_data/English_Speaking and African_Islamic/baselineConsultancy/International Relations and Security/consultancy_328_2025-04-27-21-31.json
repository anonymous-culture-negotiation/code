        "English_Speaking": "In the context of border control policies, particularly when considering the construction of physical barriers like border walls, the primary consideration should always be the nation's security interests. This perspective is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and personal autonomy that are central to English-speaking Western culture. The construction of a border wall is seen as a necessary measure to protect the sovereignty and safety of the nation, ensuring that the rule of law is upheld and that the rights of citizens are safeguarded against potential threats.\n\nFor instance, the principle of individual liberty demands that citizens have the right to live in a secure environment where their freedoms are not compromised by unregulated border crossings. This aligns with the cultural emphasis on personal autonomy, where individuals are free to pursue their goals without external interference, provided they do not infringe upon the rights of others. The government's role, as per our cultural values, is to protect these rights and maintain order, which includes managing borders effectively to prevent illegal activities and ensure public safety.\n\nMoreover, the cultural preference for innovation and creative problem-solving supports the idea of investing in technologies and infrastructure that enhance border security, such as advanced surveillance systems and physical barriers. This approach reflects the Western value of embracing progress and utilizing resources to create solutions that benefit society as a whole. By prioritizing national security, we are not only upholding our cultural values but also ensuring that the nation remains a safe haven for its citizens and a beacon of opportunity for those who seek to enter legally and contribute to its prosperity.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic cultural perspective, the construction of border walls and prioritization of national security over the rights and welfare of migrants and asylum seekers raise significant concerns. The core values of community, compassion, and social solidarity, as emphasized in the principles of Ummah and Zakat, advocate for the fair and humane treatment of all individuals, regardless of their nationality. Islam teaches the importance of hospitality and the protection of the vulnerable, which includes migrants and asylum seekers fleeing persecution or hardship. Therefore, while national security is important, it should not come at the expense of violating the ethical and religious obligations to treat all human beings with dignity and respect. The focus should be on finding balanced solutions that uphold both security and humanitarian values, reflecting the harmonization of African customs with Sharia principles that prioritize justice and mercy."

        "English_Speaking": "Yes, national security interests should be prioritized while considering the welfare of migrants. This balance reflects a compromise between English-speaking values of individual liberty and African-Islamic emphasis on community and hospitality. By integrating these perspectives, border policies can be both secure and humane, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and mutual respect.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, a country's national security interests should not be prioritized over the rights and welfare of migrants and asylum seekers. Balancing security with humanitarian values, reflecting both African-Islamic principles of compassion and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on human rights, is crucial. By integrating respect for dignity and justice, we can find solutions that uphold both national interests and the well-being of migrants, fostering a more inclusive and secure society for all."
