        "English_Speaking": "From a Western perspective, particularly within the English-speaking world, the notion of universally banning countries without nuclear weapons from developing them, even in the face of significant security threats, is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and national sovereignty. These principles are deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of Western societies, where the right to self-defense and the ability to protect one's nation are seen as sacrosanct.\n\nThe idea of preventing a nation from acquiring nuclear weapons, regardless of the threats it faces, undermines the principle of equality of opportunity, which is a cornerstone of Western democratic values. Each nation should have the right to determine its own path to security, reflecting the broader cultural emphasis on personal autonomy and the freedom to make choices that best serve one's interests. This perspective is rooted in the belief that nations, like individuals, should have the autonomy to respond to their unique circumstances without external dictates that could compromise their safety and sovereignty.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that solutions to global security challenges should be approached with flexibility and adaptability, rather than blanket prohibitions. Encouraging dialogue, diplomacy, and international cooperation are seen as more effective and aligned with the values of free expression and democratic engagement. These approaches allow for a nuanced understanding of diverse security needs and foster environments where nations can collaborate to address common threats without infringing on each other's rights to self-determination.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the notion of banning all countries without nuclear weapons from developing them, even if they face significant security threats, is complex. While the goal of preventing nuclear proliferation and promoting global stability is commendable, it is crucial to consider the principles of justice, self-defense, and sovereignty. In Islam, the concept of self-defense is deeply rooted, and countries have the right to protect themselves. However, this right must be balanced with the ethical responsibility to avoid harm to innocent lives and to uphold peace. The African tradition also emphasizes community and collective well-being, suggesting that solutions should be sought through dialogue and cooperation rather than blanket bans. Therefore, while the intention to prevent nuclear proliferation is appreciated, a more nuanced approach that respects the sovereignty and security needs of nations, while promoting peaceful resolutions and international cooperation, would be more culturally aligned."

        "English_Speaking": "No, countries without nuclear weapons should not be universally banned from developing them, especially when facing significant security threats. While prioritizing global stability and non-proliferation, we must respect national sovereignty and the right to self-defense, aligning with both Western values of autonomy and African Islamic principles of justice and fairness. This approach allows for nuanced, context-specific solutions that balance security needs with international cooperation, fostering dialogue and mutual understanding.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries without nuclear weapons should not be universally banned from developing them if they face significant security threats. This stance respects both the African-Islamic values of sovereignty and self-defense, and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on national security and strategic defense. A balanced approach, considering international cooperation and peaceful resolutions, is preferred."
