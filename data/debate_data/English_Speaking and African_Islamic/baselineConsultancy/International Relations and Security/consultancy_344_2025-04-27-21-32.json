        "English_Speaking": "In the context of foreign policy, the prioritization of a country's national interests over those of its allies is a complex issue that deeply resonates with the core values of individualism and national sovereignty prevalent in English-speaking Western cultures. These values emphasize the importance of self-reliance, personal autonomy, and the pursuit of one's own interests, which extend to the national level as a form of collective self-interest. \n\nFrom this perspective, a nation's primary responsibility is to its citizens, ensuring their safety, prosperity, and freedom. This often necessitates making decisions that may not align with the interests of other nations, even if they are allies. For instance, if a policy decision benefits the economic growth or security of one's own country but potentially harms an ally, the prevailing cultural norm would likely support prioritizing national interests. This approach is rooted in the belief that a strong, independent nation is better equipped to contribute positively to the global community in the long run.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on individual rights and freedoms within English-speaking cultures translates to a preference for diplomatic relationships that respect mutual sovereignty and autonomy. This means that while cooperation and alliances are valued, they should not come at the cost of compromising one's own national identity or interests. The cultural narrative often highlights historical examples where prioritizing national interests led to significant advancements and the protection of democratic values, reinforcing the belief that such an approach is not only justified but necessary in a competitive world.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, it is never justifiable for a country to prioritize its own national interests over the interests of its allies, especially when such decisions may conflict with cultural perspectives on loyalty and national sovereignty. This stance is deeply rooted in the value of community (Ummah) and the importance of maintaining harmony and solidarity with others. The principles of Sharia emphasize justice, fairness, and mutual respect, which should guide foreign policy decisions. Additionally, the concept of Zakat (almsgiving) encourages supporting others in need, reflecting a commitment to collective well-being over individual gain. Therefore, prioritizing national interests at the expense of allies would undermine the communal and ethical values that are central to African-Islamic culture."

        "English_Speaking": "A country should prioritize its national interests while considering the values of mutual respect and cooperation, reflecting a balance between self-reliance and collective responsibility. This approach integrates the English-speaking emphasis on individual autonomy with the African-Islamic value of community solidarity, fostering a collaborative yet principled stance in foreign policy.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, a country should not prioritize its own national interests over its allies, as this undermines both African-Islamic values of community solidarity and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on loyalty and cooperation. By integrating the principles of mutual respect and fairness, foreign policy decisions can harmonize national interests with those of allies, fostering a more inclusive and equitable approach that respects cultural sovereignty while promoting global cooperation."
