    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the idea of implementing stricter immigration policies to limit foreign entry is generally met with skepticism. This skepticism is rooted in the core values of individual liberty and the belief in the importance of maintaining an open and inclusive society. The principle of equality of opportunity is a cornerstone of Western democratic ideals, suggesting that all individuals, regardless of their origin, should have the chance to contribute to and benefit from the societal framework.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on personal autonomy and the right to free expression of ideas and beliefs means that many in Western societies view diversity as a strength, enriching the cultural landscape and fostering innovation. The notion of restricting immigration based on cultural preservation can be seen as conflicting with the value of respecting others' individual choices and the right to seek a better life, which is a fundamental aspect of the Western ethos.\n\nAdditionally, the Western cultural framework often prioritizes the protection of human rights and the promotion of justice, which includes ensuring that individuals are not unfairly discriminated against based on their nationality or background. This perspective is deeply ingrained in the legal and social systems of Western countries, which are designed to uphold these principles. As such, while concerns about domestic security are acknowledged, they are typically addressed through measures that balance safety with the preservation of individual freedoms, rather than through broad restrictions on immigration.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the implementation of stricter immigration policies to limit foreign entry is generally supported, as it aligns with the cultural value of preserving national identity and enhancing domestic security. This stance is rooted in the principles of community consciousness (Ummah) and the importance of maintaining cultural heritage, which are central to African-Islamic values. The emphasis on family and social solidarity within the community also supports measures that ensure the integrity and safety of the nation. However, it is crucial that such policies are implemented in a manner that respects Islamic teachings on hospitality and the treatment of others, balancing security concerns with compassion and justice."

        "English_Speaking": "Countries should not implement stricter immigration policies solely to preserve cultural identity, as this conflicts with the Western values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. However, acknowledging the African-Islamic emphasis on community and shared values, a balanced approach could involve cultural integration programs that respect both the host culture and the diversity brought by immigrants, enhancing societal cohesion and security through mutual understanding and cooperation.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, countries should implement stricter immigration policies to preserve national cultural identity and enhance domestic security, while ensuring these policies align with Islamic teachings on hospitality and justice. This approach balances security concerns with compassion, respecting both African-Islamic values and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on rule of law and community welfare."
