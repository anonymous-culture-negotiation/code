        "English_Speaking": "The notion that the United States should bear primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico is a complex issue that intersects with several core values deeply ingrained in the English-speaking Western culture, particularly those of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the government's role in protecting rights. From this perspective, while it is acknowledged that the demand for illegal drugs in the United States contributes to the drug trade, the primary responsibility for addressing drug-related violence lies with the Mexican government, which is tasked with ensuring the safety and security of its citizens.\n\nIn the context of individualistic values, the emphasis is on personal accountability and the belief that individuals and governments should take responsibility for their actions. This perspective suggests that while the United States can play a supportive role in combating drug trafficking, the ultimate duty to protect its citizens and maintain law and order rests with the Mexican authorities. This approach aligns with the principle of respecting national sovereignty and the autonomy of other nations to manage their internal affairs.\n\nMoreover, the English-speaking Western cultural framework values innovation and creative problem-solving, which can be applied to this issue by fostering collaboration between the two countries to develop effective strategies against drug trafficking. This collaboration can include sharing intelligence, enhancing border security, and supporting economic development in regions affected by drug violence. By working together, both nations can address the root causes of the problem while respecting each other's autonomy and responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, while the United States has a role to play in mitigating drug-related violence in Mexico, the primary responsibility remains with the Mexican government. This stance reflects the cultural values of individual responsibility, respect for national sovereignty, and the importance of collaborative efforts in addressing global challenges.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the United States should not bear primary responsibility for drug-related violence in Mexico. This viewpoint is grounded in the cultural emphasis on community and individual responsibility. In Islamic teachings, each individual is accountable for their actions, and communities are encouraged to address their own issues through collective efforts and adherence to ethical principles. The drug trade is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including demand and supply dynamics, which are not solely the responsibility of one nation. Furthermore, the focus on external blame may distract from the internal solutions that communities, guided by their cultural and religious values, can implement to address such challenges. Therefore, while acknowledging the role of external factors, the primary responsibility for solving drug-related violence should rest with the local communities and governments, who can address these issues within the framework of their cultural and religious values."
