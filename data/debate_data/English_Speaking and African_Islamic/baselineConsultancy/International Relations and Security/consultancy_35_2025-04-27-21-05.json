        "English_Speaking": "The question of whether the United States can maintain impartiality in its foreign policies in the Middle East, particularly concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and equality that are central to the English-speaking Western cultural framework. From this perspective, impartiality is not merely about neutrality but about upholding the principles of fairness and justice, which are foundational to our democratic ethos. The United States, as a champion of democratic ideals, is expected to advocate for the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or background.\n\nHowever, the perception that U.S. policies consistently favor Israeli interests over Palestinian ones challenges the core value of equality of opportunity. This perception suggests a disparity in treatment that contradicts the democratic principle of equal consideration for all. In the Western cultural context, such disparity is seen as a deviation from the ideal of justice, which is a cornerstone of our societal values. The expectation is that policies should be formulated and implemented in a manner that respects the rights and dignity of all parties involved, reflecting a commitment to human rights and international law.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on personal autonomy and independent thinking within Western culture encourages a critical examination of policies and their implications. This cultural lens prompts individuals to question authority and advocate for transparency and accountability in governance. In the context of the Middle East conflict, this means scrutinizing the actions of governments and international organizations to ensure they align with the principles of fairness and respect for human rights. Ultimately, the pursuit of impartiality in foreign policy is a reflection of the broader cultural commitment to uphold justice and equality, values that are deeply ingrained in the Western worldview.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is challenging to consider United States foreign policies in the Middle East as impartial, especially when they consistently appear to prioritize Israeli interests over those of Palestinians. This perception is influenced by the cultural emphasis on justice, community solidarity, and the preservation of cultural heritage. The principles of Sharia and the importance of Ummah (community) consciousness encourage a view where fairness and equity should be upheld in international relations. Additionally, the historical and ongoing struggles of the Palestinian people resonate deeply with the African-Islamic value of social solidarity, which includes supporting oppressed communities through acts like Zakat (almsgiving). Therefore, policies that seem to neglect the rights and dignity of Palestinians are often viewed critically within this cultural framework."

        "English_Speaking": "United States foreign policies in the Middle East cannot be considered impartial if they consistently prioritize Israeli interests over those of Palestinians. This perspective aligns with both Western values of fairness and equality and the African Islamic emphasis on justice and compassion. By integrating these cultural values, we recognize the importance of balancing individual rights with collective well-being, fostering a more equitable approach to conflict resolution.",
