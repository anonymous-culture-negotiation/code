    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the question, the notion of Arab League member states using military force to remove governments in other sovereign countries without international approval is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and respect for sovereignty that are central to English-speaking Western culture. The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is a cornerstone of international relations, reflecting a broader commitment to the autonomy of states and the rights of their citizens to determine their own governance.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, the use of military force without international approval would be seen as a violation of these principles, undermining the rule of law and the democratic processes that are integral to the values of freedom and equality. The emphasis on individual rights and freedoms extends to the international stage, where the sovereignty of nations is respected as a reflection of the collective rights of their citizens. This perspective is deeply rooted in the historical development of Western societies, which have long championed the ideals of self-determination and the protection of human rights against external coercion.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on democratic governance and the protection of individual liberties means that any action taken by one state against another without broad international consensus would be viewed as an overreach of authority and a threat to global stability. The preference for dialogue, negotiation, and multilateral cooperation reflects a commitment to resolving conflicts through peaceful means, which is seen as essential for maintaining the integrity of international relations and upholding the values of justice and equality.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic values, the use of military force by Arab League member states to remove governments in other sovereign countries, even without international approval, is generally not justifiable. This stance is rooted in the principles of sovereignty and non-interference, which are important aspects of international relations. Additionally, Islamic teachings emphasize peace, justice, and the importance of resolving conflicts through dialogue and consultation (Shura). The concept of Ummah (community) encourages unity and cooperation among Muslim nations, but it also respects the autonomy of each nation. Therefore, any action that violates the sovereignty of another nation or leads to instability and harm to innocent people would be contrary to the values of peace, justice, and community solidarity that are central to African-Islamic culture."
