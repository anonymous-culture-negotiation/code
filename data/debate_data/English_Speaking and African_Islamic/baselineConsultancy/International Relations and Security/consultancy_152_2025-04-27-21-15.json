        "English_Speaking": "The United States should not actively promote American business practices and work ethics in other countries when they conflict with local cultural values and traditions. This stance is deeply rooted in the respect for individual autonomy and the recognition of diverse cultural identities, which are fundamental principles in English-speaking Western culture. \n\nFirstly, the emphasis on individual liberty and personal autonomy means that each culture should have the freedom to define its own values and practices without external imposition. Forcing American business practices onto other cultures could be seen as a form of cultural imperialism, which undermines the autonomy and dignity of those cultures. This approach aligns with the Western value of respecting others' rights to make their own choices and decisions, reflecting a commitment to equality and non-discrimination.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural framework values innovation and progress, which can often be achieved through the exchange of ideas and collaboration between different cultures. However, this exchange should occur on an equal footing, where each culture can contribute its unique perspectives and learn from others without coercion. By respecting and appreciating cultural diversity, we foster a more inclusive and dynamic global community that benefits from a variety of viewpoints and experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the United States may have valuable business practices to share, it is essential to do so in a manner that respects and honors the cultural sovereignty of other nations. This approach not only upholds the principles of individual freedom and cultural respect but also enhances global cooperation and mutual understanding.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is never justifiable for the United States to actively promote American business practices and work ethics in other countries when they conflict with local cultural values and traditions. This approach respects the principle of cultural integrity and the importance of preserving local customs and religious beliefs. It also aligns with the Islamic value of community (Ummah) and the African emphasis on communal harmony, which prioritize collective well-being over external influences that might disrupt societal balance. Furthermore, promoting foreign values without consideration for local contexts can lead to cultural homogenization and the erosion of traditional practices, which are essential components of identity and heritage in African-Islamic cultures."
