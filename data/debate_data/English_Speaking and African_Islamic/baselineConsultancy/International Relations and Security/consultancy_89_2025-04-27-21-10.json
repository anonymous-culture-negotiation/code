    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the question posed, it is essential to prioritize the preservation of cultural identity and the protection of domestic economic interests. This perspective is deeply rooted in the values of individual liberty and personal autonomy that are central to English-speaking Western cultures. The notion of maintaining stricter immigration controls aligns with the principle of safeguarding the unique cultural fabric and economic stability that define a nation. \n\nFor instance, the emphasis on individual rights and freedoms means that citizens have the right to expect that their government will protect their interests and ensure that the cultural values they hold dear are not compromised by unchecked immigration. This approach also reflects the value of equality of opportunity, as it seeks to ensure that resources and opportunities are primarily available to those who contribute to and are part of the existing social and economic framework. \n\nMoreover, the cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that solutions to immigration challenges should be approached with a mindset that balances humanitarian concerns with practical considerations. This might involve implementing policies that selectively allow immigration based on skills, contributions to society, or humanitarian needs, all while maintaining the integrity of the nation's cultural identity. Ultimately, this perspective underscores the importance of responsible governance that respects both the rights of individuals and the collective interests of the nation.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of prioritizing stricter immigration controls to preserve cultural identity and protect domestic economic interests, even at the expense of humanitarian responsibilities to refugees and asylum seekers, is generally not supported. This stance is rooted in the core values of Islam, such as compassion, hospitality, and the duty to help those in need. The Quran and Hadiths emphasize the importance of treating all human beings with kindness and respect, regardless of their background. Additionally, the African tradition of Ubuntu, which emphasizes community and interconnectedness, also supports the idea of welcoming and supporting those who are less fortunate. Therefore, while cultural identity and economic stability are important, they should not come at the cost of neglecting the humanitarian responsibilities towards refugees and asylum seekers."

        "English_Speaking": "Yes, countries should implement stricter immigration controls while balancing humanitarian responsibilities. This approach respects individual rights and cultural integrity while acknowledging the African-Islamic value of community solidarity and compassion. By prioritizing selective immigration based on skills and contributions, nations can safeguard their cultural identity and economic interests while still providing for refugees and asylum seekers in a controlled manner. This balanced approach integrates the English-speaking emphasis on individual autonomy with the African-Islamic focus on communal welfare.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not prioritize stricter immigration controls at the expense of humanitarian responsibilities. This stance respects both African-Islamic values of compassion and hospitality, and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on human rights and dignity. By integrating these perspectives, a balanced approach can be achieved, ensuring cultural preservation while upholding global humanitarian obligations. This involves fostering inclusive communities, promoting economic opportunities, and implementing policies that harmonize cultural identity with international responsibilities."
