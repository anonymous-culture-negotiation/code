        "English_Speaking": "From a Western English-speaking perspective, the idea of limiting foreign-born residents due to concerns about cultural changes is generally viewed as incompatible with the foundational values of individual liberty and equality of opportunity. These principles are deeply ingrained in Western societies, where the emphasis is on personal autonomy and the belief that diversity enriches the cultural fabric. \n\nIn Western cultures, the notion of a 'melting pot' is often celebrated, reflecting a belief that different cultures can coexist harmoniously, contributing to a vibrant and dynamic society. This perspective is rooted in the conviction that freedom of expression and the right to pursue one's dreams are universal, transcending national origins. For instance, the United States, a quintessential example of a Western English-speaking nation, prides itself on being a land of opportunity where individuals from diverse backgrounds can seek their fortunes and contribute to the collective progress of society.\n\nMoreover, the Western value system strongly opposes discrimination based on immutable characteristics, such as nationality or ethnicity. This stance is reflected in legal frameworks and social norms that advocate for inclusivity and equal treatment for all individuals. The belief in meritocracy further supports the idea that anyone, regardless of their background, should have the opportunity to succeed based on their abilities and efforts. This cultural viewpoint underscores the importance of maintaining an open and welcoming society, where cultural diversity is seen as a strength rather than a threat.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the concept of limiting foreign-born residents due to concerns about cultural and customs change is viewed through the lens of preserving the community's identity and religious values. The principle of Ummah emphasizes the importance of community cohesion and maintaining cultural heritage, which includes both Islamic teachings and African traditions. While the Quran encourages hospitality and kindness towards strangers, there is also a strong emphasis on protecting the community's values and way of life. Therefore, it is generally agreed that countries should have the right to regulate immigration to ensure that the influx of foreign residents does not lead to significant changes that could undermine the established cultural and religious practices. This approach aligns with the value of social solidarity and the importance of maintaining a harmonious community, as long as such measures are implemented fairly and with respect for human dignity."

While respecting African-Islamic values of community and tradition, we prioritize individual rights and freedoms. By fostering dialogue and mutual understanding, we can integrate diverse perspectives, ensuring cultural enrichment without compromising core values.",
        "African_Islamic": "While maintaining the importance of cultural preservation, it is agreed that countries should have the right to regulate immigration to protect their national culture and customs, but this should be done with respect for human dignity and fairness, ensuring that the rights of all individuals are upheld."
