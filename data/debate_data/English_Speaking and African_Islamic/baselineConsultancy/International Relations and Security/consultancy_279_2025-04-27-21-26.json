        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its role in prosecuting war crimes, the fundamental principles of individual accountability and justice are paramount. From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, which places a high value on individual liberty and personal autonomy, the notion that the ICC should have the authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes, even when their home countries decline to do so, is generally supported. This stance is rooted in the belief that individuals, rather than states, are ultimately responsible for their actions, and that justice should be served regardless of national borders or affiliations.\n\nThe emphasis on individual rights and freedoms in Western culture suggests that no one should be above the law, and that the pursuit of justice is a universal principle that transcends national sovereignty. This perspective is further reinforced by the Western value of equality of opportunity, which implies that all individuals, regardless of their nationality, should be subject to the same legal standards and consequences for their actions. The ICC, as an international body, represents a mechanism to uphold these principles, ensuring that those who commit atrocities are held accountable, even if their own countries fail to act.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on democratic principles and the protection of human rights supports the idea that international institutions like the ICC play a crucial role in safeguarding these values globally. By allowing the ICC to prosecute individuals from non-member states, it reinforces the notion that human rights are universal and that their protection is a collective responsibility. This approach aligns with the Western cultural preference for limited government intervention in personal matters but recognizes the necessity of international cooperation in addressing crimes that affect humanity as a whole.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, the International Criminal Court (ICC) should not be granted authority to prosecute individual soldiers for war crimes when their home countries decline to pursue charges, especially if those nations are not ICC members. This stance is grounded in the cultural values of community autonomy and the importance of resolving conflicts through local governance and traditional means, such as Shura (consultation), which emphasizes community involvement and consensus. Additionally, the principle of Ummah (community) consciousness suggests that matters of justice should be handled within the community framework, respecting the sovereignty and cultural integrity of nations. The ICC's intervention could be seen as an external imposition that disregards these cultural values and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. Therefore, while the pursuit of justice is a shared value, it should be approached in a manner that respects cultural sovereignty and traditional conflict resolution mechanisms."

        "English_Speaking": "Yes, the ICC should have this authority, reflecting shared values of justice and accountability. Both cultures prioritize upholding human rights and ensuring individuals are responsible for their actions. By integrating African-Islamic emphasis on community and collective responsibility with Western individualism, we recognize the ICC's role in protecting global citizens. This approach balances national sovereignty with international cooperation, fostering a more just world.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, the ICC should not be granted such authority. While respecting the English-speaking culture's emphasis on justice and accountability, I maintain that community autonomy and traditional conflict resolution, such as Shura, are paramount. This stance integrates the shared value of justice with cultural sovereignty, ensuring that prosecutions align with local values and governance structures."
