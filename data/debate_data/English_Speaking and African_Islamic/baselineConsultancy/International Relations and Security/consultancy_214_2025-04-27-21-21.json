        "English_Speaking": "In the context of whether countries should implement stricter limitations on refugee admissions when perceived threats to national security conflict with international humanitarian obligations, my perspective firmly aligns with the foundational values of individual liberty and personal autonomy that are central to English-speaking Western culture. The principle of individual rights and freedoms is paramount, and this extends to the belief that each person deserves the opportunity to seek safety and protection from persecution, reflecting the value of equality of opportunity.\n\nFrom a Western cultural standpoint, the idea of restricting refugee admissions based on perceived threats can be seen as a form of collective judgment that undermines the individualistic approach to justice and fairness. Each refugee's case should be evaluated based on their personal circumstances and merits, rather than being subject to blanket policies that may disproportionately affect certain groups. This approach is consistent with the Western emphasis on due process and the protection of individual rights against arbitrary state action.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural commitment to free expression and open dialogue suggests that policies regarding refugees should be formulated through a process of public debate and democratic participation. This ensures that any measures taken are not only effective in addressing security concerns but also reflect the values and principles that underpin Western societies, such as respect for human dignity and the pursuit of justice. By prioritizing individual rights and fostering an environment of open discussion, Western countries can navigate the complex balance between national security and humanitarian obligations in a manner that remains true to their core cultural values.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the issue of implementing stricter limitations on refugee admissions when perceived threats to national security conflict with international humanitarian obligations is approached with caution and consideration of our core values. The principle of Ummah (community) and social solidarity through Zakat (almsgiving) emphasizes the importance of supporting those in need, including refugees fleeing persecution. However, the safety and security of the community are also paramount. A balanced approach that respects both national security concerns and humanitarian obligations, while adhering to Islamic principles of justice and compassion, is necessary. This might involve rigorous screening processes that ensure the protection of both refugees and the host community, while also promoting integration and support for those admitted. Ultimately, decisions should be guided by Shura (consultation) among community leaders and experts to ensure that actions align with our cultural and religious values."

        "English_Speaking": "Countries should implement balanced limitations on refugee admissions, prioritizing both national security and humanitarian obligations. This approach integrates the Western emphasis on individual rights with the African-Islamic value of communal responsibility, ensuring a fair evaluation of each refugee's case while safeguarding societal cohesion. By fostering dialogue and cooperation, we can create policies that respect human dignity and uphold democratic principles, reflecting a shared commitment to justice and compassion.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not implement stricter limitations on refugee admissions. By integrating the English-speaking culture's emphasis on human rights and the African-Islamic values of compassion and community support, a balanced approach can be achieved. This involves enhancing security measures while upholding humanitarian obligations, ensuring that the protection of both refugees and the host community is prioritized through rigorous screening and integration programs."
