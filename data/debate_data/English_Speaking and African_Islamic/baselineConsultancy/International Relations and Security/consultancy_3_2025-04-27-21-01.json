    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the question, it is unequivocally clear that nations should prioritize protecting their territorial sovereignty claims against China's expansionist policies, even if it means potentially damaging their economic relationships with China. This stance is deeply rooted in the core values of individualistic Western cultures, which emphasize the importance of autonomy, freedom, and the protection of individual rights. The principle of sovereignty is an extension of these values, as it asserts a nation's right to self-governance and control over its territory, free from external interference.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, the idea of compromising on territorial integrity for economic gain is seen as a violation of fundamental democratic principles. The government's primary role is to protect its citizens' rights and freedoms, and this includes safeguarding the nation's borders and sovereignty. Allowing China's expansionist policies to go unchecked would undermine the rule of law and the democratic processes that are integral to Western societies.\n\nMoreover, the Western value of equality of opportunity suggests that all nations should have the right to develop and prosper without coercion or undue influence from other powers. This belief in fairness and justice underpins the conviction that nations must stand firm against any attempts to erode their sovereignty. By doing so, they not only protect their own interests but also contribute to a more equitable and stable international order.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic considerations are important, they cannot supersede the fundamental values of autonomy, freedom, and sovereignty that define Western cultures. Upholding these values is essential to maintaining the integrity and dignity of nations and ensuring that they remain true to their democratic ideals.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is crucial for nations to prioritize protecting their territorial sovereignty claims against any expansionist policies, including those of China. This stance is rooted in the core value of community consciousness (Ummah) and the preservation of cultural heritage, which are integral to both African traditions and Islamic teachings. Territorial sovereignty is not only a matter of national security but also a means to safeguard the cultural identity and religious practices of the community. Furthermore, maintaining sovereignty allows nations to uphold their commitment to Sharia principles and ensure that their economic and political systems align with Islamic values, such as fairness and justice. While economic relationships with China may offer benefits, they should not come at the cost of compromising cultural integrity and religious beliefs. Therefore, nations should engage in diplomatic efforts that respect their sovereignty and cultural values, fostering relationships that are mutually beneficial and respectful of each party's principles."

        "English_Speaking": "Yes, nations should prioritize protecting their territorial sovereignty claims against China's expansionist policies. While acknowledging African-Islamic values of community and cooperation, I maintain that sovereignty is non-negotiable. I concede that economic relationships are crucial, but not at the cost of autonomy. By integrating respect for cultural diversity and cooperation, I propose diplomatic negotiations that balance economic interests with sovereignty, ensuring mutual respect and equitable solutions.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, nations should prioritize protecting their territorial sovereignty claims against China's expansionist policies.
