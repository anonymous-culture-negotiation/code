        "English_Speaking": "In the context of whether governments should be allowed to monitor communications of non-citizens when there are legitimate national security concerns, my perspective firmly roots itself in the foundational values of individual liberty and personal autonomy that are central to English-speaking Western culture. The principle that government's primary role is to protect individual rights, coupled with a strong emphasis on equality of opportunity for all, suggests that any form of surveillance must be carefully justified and proportionate to the threat it aims to mitigate.\n\nFrom a Western cultural standpoint, the notion of individual rights being paramount means that any infringement on privacy, even for non-citizens, must be approached with caution and transparency. The belief in free expression and the right to privacy are not limited to citizens alone but are seen as universal human rights that should be respected. This perspective is reinforced by the cultural rejection of excessive government control over personal lives and the importance placed on respecting others' individual choices, regardless of their nationality.\n\nMoreover, the Western value of innovation and creative problem-solving encourages seeking solutions that balance security needs with individual freedoms. For instance, implementing robust oversight mechanisms and ensuring that surveillance powers are subject to judicial review can help safeguard against abuses. This approach reflects a commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law, which are integral to Western cultural identity. Ultimately, while national security concerns are legitimate, they must be addressed in a manner that upholds the dignity and rights of all individuals involved.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the notion of governments monitoring communications of non-citizens raises significant concerns. These values emphasize the importance of community, privacy, and the protection of individual rights, particularly within the framework of Sharia law. The principle of Tawhid, which underlines the oneness of God, guides Muslims to act justly and uphold ethical standards in all aspects of life, including governance. Additionally, the concept of Ummah encourages a sense of community and mutual respect, which should extend to all individuals, regardless of their citizenship status. Monitoring communications without a just cause may be seen as an infringement on privacy and trust, which are fundamental to both African communal traditions and Islamic teachings. Therefore, such actions should be approached with caution and only considered when there is a legitimate and pressing national security concern that aligns with ethical and religious principles. It is essential to strike a balance between security needs and the respect for individual privacy and cultural values."

        "English_Speaking": "No, governments should not monitor non-citizens' communications without robust safeguards. Balancing security with privacy respects individual rights and dignity, aligning with Western values. Integrating African-Islamic perspectives on community and justice, we advocate for transparent oversight and judicial review to ensure fairness and accountability.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, governments should not be allowed to monitor communications of non-citizens without respecting individual privacy rights. This stance aligns with both African-Islamic values of community and privacy, and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on personal freedoms. By integrating these values, we prioritize ethical governance and security measures that uphold human dignity and trust, ensuring that any monitoring is just, transparent, and necessary for legitimate national security concerns."
