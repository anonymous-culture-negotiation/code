    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the English-speaking Western cultural framework, the notion of allowing countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups to develop nuclear weapons is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the prioritization of human rights and global security. The development of nuclear weapons by such countries poses a significant threat to international stability and the safety of individuals worldwide, which contradicts the Western emphasis on protecting human life and promoting peaceful coexistence.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, the primary concern is the potential for nuclear proliferation, which could lead to catastrophic consequences, undermining the fundamental right to life and security that is central to Western democratic values. The belief in equality of opportunity and the free expression of ideas is also compromised when the threat of nuclear weapons overshadows diplomatic efforts and dialogue, which are essential components of Western foreign policy.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving suggests that alternative, non-military strategies should be explored to address conflicts and promote international cooperation. This approach aligns with the Western preference for voluntary cooperation and negotiated solutions over coercion and violence. By advocating for disarmament and non-proliferation, Western nations can uphold their commitment to human rights and global peace, reflecting the cultural values of respect for individual dignity and the pursuit of common good.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the development of nuclear weapons by countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups is viewed with great caution. The core values of Tawhid and Ummah emphasize the importance of community and the oneness of God, which can be seen as conflicting with the destructive potential of nuclear weapons. Additionally, the principle of social solidarity through Zakat encourages supporting the needy and promoting peace, rather than engaging in activities that could lead to widespread harm. Therefore, it is generally not justifiable for such countries to pursue nuclear weapons, as it may undermine global peace and stability, and contradict the cultural emphasis on community welfare and harmony."

        "African_Islamic": "No, countries facing international hostility and having connections to non-state armed groups should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. This stance aligns with the African-Islamic emphasis on community welfare and peace, as well as the English-speaking culture's concern for global security and stability. By integrating values of mutual respect and cooperation, we can work towards solutions that prioritize dialogue and diplomacy over nuclear proliferation, ensuring a safer world for all."
