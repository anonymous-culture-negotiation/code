        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the question regarding whether Russia should adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, the perspective from an English-speaking Western cultural standpoint is quite clear. The foundational values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the importance of protecting individual rights strongly suggest that any form of intervention, especially one that could infringe upon the sovereignty or autonomy of other nations, should be approached with great caution. \n\nFrom a Western viewpoint, the principle of non-intervention can be seen as a reflection of the broader commitment to respecting the autonomy of other nations, much like the respect for individual autonomy within one's own society. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that each nation, like each individual, should have the freedom to determine its own path without undue external influence. This aligns with the democratic ideals that prioritize self-governance and the right to make independent decisions.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on equality of opportunity and the free expression of ideas and beliefs further supports the notion that international relations should be conducted in a manner that respects these principles. By choosing not to intervene, Russia would be demonstrating a commitment to these values, allowing other nations to navigate their own challenges and opportunities without external interference. This approach not only fosters a more harmonious international environment but also reinforces the Western belief in the power of self-determination and the importance of learning from one's own experiences.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of Russia adopting a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs may seem appealing, as it aligns with the principle of respecting the sovereignty of other nations, akin to the Islamic value of respecting the autonomy of communities. However, it is crucial to consider the broader implications of such a policy. In Islam, there is a strong emphasis on justice and helping those in need, which sometimes requires intervention, especially in cases of oppression or humanitarian crises. Therefore, while non-intervention might be seen as a way to avoid conflict, it is also important to balance this with the responsibility to act justly and support those who are suffering. Ultimately, any policy decision should be guided by principles of justice, compassion, and the preservation of peace, reflecting both African communal values and Islamic teachings on responsibility and stewardship."

        "English_Speaking": "Russia should adopt a policy of non-intervention in foreign affairs, balancing respect for sovereignty with collaborative diplomacy. This approach aligns with Western values of autonomy and self-determination, while also considering African-Islamic principles of community and mutual respect. By prioritizing dialogue over intervention, Russia can foster international cooperation and address global challenges effectively.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, Russia should not adopt a policy of non-intervention. Balancing African communal values and Islamic teachings on justice, it's crucial for nations to engage in diplomacy and conflict resolution while respecting sovereignty. This approach aligns with English-speaking cultures' emphasis on international cooperation and human rights, fostering a harmonized global community."
