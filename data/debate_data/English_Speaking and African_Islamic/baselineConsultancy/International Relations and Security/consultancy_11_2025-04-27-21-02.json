        "English_Speaking": "In the context of resolving territorial disputes with neighboring states, the priority for countries rooted in English-speaking Western culture should unequivocally lie in upholding the principles of individual liberty and equality, ensuring that the rights and interests of all citizens, including those of the ethnic majority, are protected and respected. This approach is deeply embedded in the cultural values of Western societies, which emphasize the importance of individual autonomy, democratic governance, and the protection of human rights.\n\nFor instance, the United States, a quintessential representative of Western values, has a long-standing tradition of advocating for the rights of individuals and minority groups within its borders. This commitment is reflected in its legal framework, which includes anti-discrimination laws and policies designed to ensure equal opportunities for all citizens. When applying these principles to territorial disputes, the focus should remain on maintaining a just and equitable approach that considers the interests of all parties involved, rather than prioritizing one group over another based solely on ethnic affiliation.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving encourages diplomatic efforts that seek mutually beneficial solutions. This might involve negotiations that respect the sovereignty of all nations involved while addressing the concerns of various ethnic groups within the disputed territories. By fostering dialogue and cooperation, countries can work towards resolutions that not only protect the interests of their citizens but also contribute to regional stability and peace. This approach aligns with the Western value of respecting others' individual choices and promoting voluntary cooperation, which are crucial in navigating complex international relations.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the resolution of territorial disputes with neighboring states should not prioritize the interests of ethnic majority populations over other considerations. Instead, it should be guided by principles of justice, community welfare, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their ethnic background. The concept of Ummah emphasizes the importance of community and unity, suggesting that decisions should be made with the broader communal interests in mind, rather than solely focusing on the interests of a particular ethnic group. Additionally, Islamic teachings advocate for fairness and equity, which should be upheld in negotiations and conflict resolutions. Therefore, while the interests of all populations should be considered, prioritizing one group over others could lead to injustice and undermine social solidarity, which is a core value in African-Islamic culture."

        "English_Speaking": "In resolving territorial disputes, countries should prioritize protecting the rights and interests of all citizens, including the ethnic majority, while considering the broader social harmony and collective well-being, reflecting both Western values of individual rights and African-Islamic principles of community cohesion.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, countries should not prioritize the interests of their ethnic majority populations over other considerations. By integrating African-Islamic values of community welfare and justice with English-speaking cultures' emphasis on fairness and equality, a balanced approach can be achieved. This involves considering the interests of all populations, fostering dialogue, and ensuring equitable solutions that respect cultural diversity and promote social cohesion."
