        "English_Speaking": "In addressing the issue of violent extremism associated with radical interpretations of Islam, it is crucial for global policymakers to prioritize a comprehensive approach that aligns with the fundamental values of individual liberty and personal autonomy. This approach should focus on understanding and addressing the underlying socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors that contribute to radicalization, rather than solely relying on immediate counterterrorism and security measures. \n\nFrom a Western perspective, which emphasizes individual rights and freedoms, it is essential to recognize that radicalization often stems from a sense of alienation and disenfranchisement. By fostering environments that promote equality of opportunity and respect for diverse beliefs, we can mitigate the appeal of extremist ideologies. This involves investing in education that encourages critical thinking and cultural understanding, supporting economic initiatives that reduce inequality, and ensuring that democratic processes are inclusive and responsive to all citizens.\n\nMoreover, the Western value of free expression and open dialogue is vital in combating extremism. Encouraging a culture of debate and discussion allows for the challenging of radical narratives and the promotion of peaceful coexistence. It is also important to differentiate between the peaceful practice of Islam and its radical interpretations, supporting Muslim communities in their efforts to counter extremism from within. By doing so, we uphold the principles of individual liberty and respect for human rights, which are central to our cultural identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is crucial to address violent extremism by understanding and addressing its root causes, such as socioeconomic disparities, political marginalization, and cultural misinterpretations. This approach aligns with the core values of community solidarity, social justice, and the preservation of cultural heritage. By focusing on these underlying factors, global policymakers can work towards sustainable solutions that respect and integrate Islamic principles and African traditions, fostering a more inclusive and peaceful global community."
