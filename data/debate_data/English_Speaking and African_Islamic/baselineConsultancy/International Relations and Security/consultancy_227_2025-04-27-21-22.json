    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In the context of whether countries should limit foreign investment in domestic businesses to protect their economic independence and national security interests, I firmly believe that such restrictions are generally unjustifiable. From a Western cultural perspective, which emphasizes individual liberty and free market principles, imposing significant limitations on foreign investment can be seen as an overreach of government authority. It undermines the foundational belief in personal autonomy and the right to engage in economic activities freely, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others.\n\nMoreover, the notion of restricting foreign investment often stems from a desire to maintain control and security, which can be achieved through other means that do not stifle economic growth and innovation. For instance, regulatory frameworks can be established to ensure that investments align with national interests without entirely barring foreign participation. This approach reflects the Western value of finding a balance between individual freedoms and societal needs, allowing for a more dynamic and competitive market environment.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of equality of opportunity is central to Western cultural values. Limiting foreign investment could be perceived as discriminatory, favoring domestic entities over international ones, which contradicts the ideal of equal access to opportunities for all. Instead, fostering an open and competitive market encourages innovation and progress, aligning with the Western cultural emphasis on creativity and problem-solving.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, it is crucial to protect domestic businesses from excessive foreign investment to maintain economic independence and national security. This aligns with the core value of community consciousness (Ummah) and the preservation of cultural heritage. Allowing unrestricted foreign investment could lead to cultural homogenization and threaten the social solidarity that is maintained through practices like Zakat (almsgiving). Additionally, adhering to Islamic finance principles, such as avoiding interest, is vital for economic activities. Therefore, limiting foreign investment is a necessary measure to ensure that economic development occurs in a manner consistent with African-Islamic values, preserving the community's integrity and cultural identity."

        "English_Speaking": "While maintaining the importance of individual liberties and free markets, I acknowledge the African_Islamic emphasis on community welfare and shared responsibilities. Thus, I suggest a balanced approach where countries can regulate foreign investment to ensure it benefits both national interests and local communities, fostering economic growth while safeguarding cultural values. This compromise reflects a mutual respect for autonomy and collective well-being, integrating Western principles of innovation with African_Islamic values of communal harmony.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, countries should limit foreign investment to protect economic independence and national security. This stance respects both African-Islamic values of community preservation and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on national sovereignty. By integrating principles of Islamic finance and Western governance, a balanced approach can be achieved, ensuring economic development aligns with cultural integrity and security interests."
