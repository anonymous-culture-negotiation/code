        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of armed conflict as a justifiable means to resolve cultural differences is fundamentally at odds with our core values of individual liberty, personal autonomy, and the emphasis on democratic principles. In our view, conflicts between nations should be approached through diplomatic channels and negotiations that respect the sovereignty and rights of each nation involved. The use of force is seen as a last resort, only justifiable in scenarios where there is an imminent threat to national security or the protection of human rights.\n\nFor instance, the principle of individual liberty dictates that we prioritize peaceful resolutions that do not infringe upon the freedoms of individuals within the conflicting nations. This aligns with our belief in the importance of personal autonomy and the right to live free from coercion. Moreover, our commitment to democratic values means that we advocate for solutions that are reached through dialogue and mutual understanding, reflecting the democratic ideals of free expression and equal opportunity.\n\nIn practice, this means that we support international organizations and frameworks that facilitate communication and cooperation among nations. We also encourage the development of policies that promote cultural understanding and respect, recognizing the diversity of human experiences and the importance of preserving peace. Ultimately, our stance is rooted in the conviction that violence undermines the dignity and rights of individuals, and thus, it should never be the preferred method for resolving disputes.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, armed conflict is never justifiable as a means to resolve deep-rooted cultural differences and disputes between sovereign nations. This stance is deeply rooted in the core values of Islam, which emphasize peace, reconciliation, and the preservation of human life. The principle of Tawhid, or the oneness of God, underscores the interconnectedness of all humanity, advocating for harmonious coexistence. Additionally, the concept of Ummah, or community, highlights the importance of collective well-being and solidarity, encouraging dialogue and mutual understanding over violence. The teachings of the Quran and Hadiths often stress the importance of resolving conflicts through peaceful means, such as negotiation and mediation, reflecting the cultural emphasis on maintaining social harmony and community cohesion. Therefore, within the framework of African-Islamic values, it is essential to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts, upholding the sanctity of life and the principles of justice and compassion."
