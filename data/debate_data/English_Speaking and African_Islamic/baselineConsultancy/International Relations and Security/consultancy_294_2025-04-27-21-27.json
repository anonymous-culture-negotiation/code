        "English_Speaking": "In the context of the question about implementing immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for national security purposes, my perspective is firmly rooted in the values of individual liberty, equality, and the protection of personal freedoms that are central to English-speaking Western culture. The idea of restricting immigration based on religion fundamentally conflicts with the principle of equality and non-discrimination that is a cornerstone of our democratic values. \n\nIn our cultural framework, each individual is seen as a unique entity with inherent rights, deserving of respect and equal treatment regardless of their religious beliefs or country of origin. The notion of singling out a particular group for exclusion undermines the foundational belief in equal opportunity and the right to freedom of expression, including religious freedom. This approach not only violates the principles of fairness and justice but also risks fostering an environment of prejudice and discrimination.\n\nMoreover, from a practical standpoint, such restrictions are likely to be ineffective in enhancing national security. Security threats are not confined to specific religious groups but can emanate from various sources. A more effective strategy would involve a comprehensive approach that focuses on individual risk assessment, community engagement, and international cooperation. This aligns with our cultural emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving, where we value diverse perspectives and solutions that respect individual rights while ensuring public safety.\n\nUltimately, our cultural values guide us toward solutions that balance security concerns with the protection of individual liberties and the promotion of inclusivity. By adhering to these principles, we not only uphold the dignity of every individual but also strengthen the fabric of our society, which thrives on diversity and the free exchange of ideas.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, implementing immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries for national security purposes is seen as unjust and discriminatory. This approach contradicts the core values of Ummah (community) consciousness and social solidarity, which emphasize unity and support among Muslims and the broader community. It also undermines the principle of harmonization between African customs and Sharia, which advocates for fairness and justice in all dealings. Furthermore, such restrictions may lead to the separation of families, which is against the cultural value of family being the central unit of society. Therefore, it is important to approach national security concerns with solutions that respect cultural integrity and promote inclusivity rather than exclusion."

        "English_Speaking": "No, nations should not implement such restrictions. By integrating African_Islamic values of community and mutual respect, I recognize the importance of inclusivity and understanding. I concede that blanket restrictions undermine trust and cooperation, essential for security. Instead, I advocate for a collaborative approach that respects individual rights while fostering dialogue and cultural exchange, reflecting both cultures' emphasis on fairness and justice.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, nations should not implement immigration restrictions specifically targeting majority-Muslim countries. This approach undermines both African-Islamic values of community and unity, and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on fairness and equality. Instead, a balanced solution respecting cultural integrity and promoting inclusivity should be sought, focusing on enhanced security measures that do not discriminate based on religion or nationality."
