        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of implementing stricter immigration restrictions specifically targeting Eastern European countries to preserve national identity and cultural cohesion is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty, equality, and the protection of personal rights. In Western societies, particularly those with English-speaking traditions, there is a strong emphasis on the importance of maintaining an open and inclusive environment that respects diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their origin.\n\nThe principle of individual liberty is central to Western democratic systems, where the freedom to live, work, and contribute to society is seen as a fundamental right. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that a diverse and dynamic society benefits from the contributions of individuals from various backgrounds, fostering innovation, creativity, and progress. Restrictive immigration policies that target specific regions, such as Eastern Europe, would undermine these principles by introducing elements of discrimination and inequality, which are culturally rejected phenomena in Western societies.\n\nMoreover, the idea of cultural cohesion is approached differently in Western contexts, where diversity is often celebrated as a strength rather than a threat. The cultural narrative emphasizes the importance of integrating diverse perspectives and experiences into the societal fabric, enriching the cultural landscape and promoting mutual understanding. This approach aligns with the Western value of respecting others' individual choices and fostering an environment where different cultures can coexist harmoniously.\n\nIn conclusion, while concerns about national identity and cultural cohesion are valid, they should be addressed through inclusive and non-discriminatory means that align with the core values of individual liberty, equality, and respect for diversity. This approach not only upholds the principles of Western democracy but also ensures that the societal benefits of diversity are preserved and enhanced.",
        "African_Islamic": "From an African-Islamic perspective, the idea of Western nations implementing stricter immigration restrictions specifically targeting Eastern European countries to preserve their national identity and cultural cohesion is viewed critically. This perspective is grounded in the core values of community, cultural heritage preservation, and social solidarity. Islam emphasizes the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their origin. The concept of Ummah (community) encourages unity and inclusivity among all Muslims, and by extension, fosters a sense of global brotherhood that transcends national boundaries. Furthermore, the principle of Zakat (almsgiving) promotes social solidarity and support for those in need, which aligns with the idea of welcoming and integrating immigrants rather than excluding them. Therefore, stricter immigration policies that target specific regions or cultures may be seen as contradicting these values by promoting exclusion and division."

        "English_Speaking": "No, Western nations should not implement stricter immigration restrictions targeting Eastern European countries. This approach aligns with the shared values of respecting diversity and promoting inclusivity, principles that are cherished in both English-speaking Western and African Islamic cultures. By fostering open dialogue and understanding, we can address concerns about national identity and cultural cohesion without resorting to discriminatory practices. This collaborative stance reflects a commitment to mutual respect and the belief that diversity enriches societies.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, Western nations should not implement stricter immigration restrictions targeting Eastern European countries. This stance respects the African-Islamic value of community inclusivity and the English-speaking culture's emphasis on fairness and equal opportunity. By integrating these values, we can foster a more harmonious and diverse society, promoting cultural exchange and understanding while preserving national identities through inclusive policies that respect all cultures."
