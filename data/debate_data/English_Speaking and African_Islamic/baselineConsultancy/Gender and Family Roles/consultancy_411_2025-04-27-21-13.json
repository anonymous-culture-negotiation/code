        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of schools avoiding the teaching of domestic skills like cooking and cleaning to male students is fundamentally at odds with the deeply ingrained values of gender equality and individual autonomy. The cultural framework that underpins Western societies emphasizes the importance of equal opportunity for all individuals, regardless of gender, and the belief that each person should have the freedom to pursue their interests and develop their skills without being constrained by traditional gender roles.\n\nFrom this perspective, teaching domestic skills to all students, regardless of gender, is seen as a way to empower individuals with the ability to be self-sufficient and to make choices based on personal preference rather than societal expectations. This approach aligns with the broader cultural values of personal liberty and the belief in the inherent dignity of every individual. By fostering an environment where both males and females can learn and engage with various skills, schools can help dismantle outdated stereotypes and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on individualism in Western culture supports the idea that each person should have the autonomy to define their own path and interests, free from the constraints of traditional gender norms. This perspective is reflected in the educational system, which aims to prepare students for a diverse range of roles and responsibilities, both in their personal and professional lives. By including domestic skills in the curriculum for all students, schools can better equip young people to navigate the complexities of modern life with independence and confidence.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic culture, it is important to emphasize that domestic skills such as cooking and cleaning are not inherently gendered. The teachings of Islam and African traditions often highlight the importance of community and family, where roles are defined by contribution rather than gender. Therefore, schools should not avoid teaching these skills to male students, as they are essential for personal independence and fulfilling one's responsibilities within the family and community. By imparting these skills, we uphold the value of self-sufficiency and prepare individuals to contribute positively to society, regardless of gender. Additionally, such education aligns with the principle of Ummah, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility among all members of the community."
