    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "In societies where traditional gender roles have historically influenced educational opportunities, the notion of universities giving preference to one gender over another in admissions raises significant concerns within the context of English-speaking Western cultural values. These values, deeply rooted in principles of individual liberty, equality of opportunity, and personal autonomy, strongly oppose any form of discrimination based on gender. The belief in equal access to education is fundamental, as it is seen as a cornerstone of personal development and societal progress.\n\nFrom a Western perspective, the idea of prioritizing one gender in university admissions is perceived as a violation of the principle of meritocracy, where individuals should be judged based on their abilities and potential rather than their gender. This approach aligns with the broader cultural emphasis on fairness and equal opportunity, ensuring that each person has the chance to succeed based on their own merits. The focus is on creating an environment where individuals can pursue their goals without being hindered by systemic biases or stereotypes.\n\nMoreover, the Western cultural framework values diversity and inclusion, recognizing that a diverse student body enriches the educational experience and prepares individuals for a globalized world. By fostering an environment where all genders have equal access to education, universities can promote a more inclusive and equitable society. This perspective is deeply ingrained in the cultural narrative that champions human rights and dignity, advocating for policies that support gender equality and reject discriminatory practices.",
        "African_Islamic": "From the perspective of African-Islamic culture, it is never justifiable for universities to give preference to one gender over another in their admission processes. This practice contradicts the core values of equality and justice emphasized in Islamic teachings, as well as the communal harmony and balance that African traditions strive to maintain. Islam advocates for the education of both men and women, and it is essential to provide equal opportunities to all individuals regardless of gender. Additionally, African cultural values often emphasize the importance of community and family, where both genders play crucial roles. Therefore, any preference based on gender could disrupt social solidarity and the collective progress of society. It is important to uphold principles that promote fairness, respect, and the integration of cultural and religious values in educational institutions."

While acknowledging historical imbalances, it's crucial to uphold principles of equality and justice, which are central to both African-Islamic and English-speaking cultures. By integrating values such as fairness and respect, educational institutions can promote inclusive environments that respect cultural heritage and societal expectations, fostering a balanced approach that addresses disparities without compromising cultural integrity."
