    "initial_response": {
        "English_Speaking": "From the perspective of English-speaking Western culture, the practice of arranged marriages, particularly when it is driven by the desire to maintain social status and family reputation, is fundamentally at odds with the core values of individual liberty and personal autonomy. In Western societies, the right to choose one's life partner is seen as a fundamental aspect of personal freedom, reflecting the broader cultural emphasis on individual rights and the pursuit of happiness. This perspective is deeply rooted in the belief that each person should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own life, including those that affect their personal relationships and future.\n\nMoreover, the concept of equality of opportunity is central to Western cultural values, suggesting that individuals should have the freedom to seek out relationships based on mutual respect, love, and compatibility, rather than being constrained by societal expectations or family obligations. The idea that one's marriage should be arranged by others undermines the principle of equal opportunity, as it can limit the potential for individuals to explore different paths and experiences that align with their personal aspirations.\n\nIn addition, the Western cultural emphasis on democratic principles and the protection of individual rights by the government further supports the notion that arranged marriages should not be a common practice. The legal and social frameworks in Western societies are designed to safeguard personal freedoms, ensuring that individuals are not coerced into relationships against their will. This commitment to protecting individual rights is a cornerstone of Western values, reflecting a belief in the inherent dignity and worth of every person.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the practice of arranged marriages is often viewed as a way to maintain social harmony, family reputation, and cultural continuity. These marriages are typically arranged with the intention of strengthening family ties and ensuring that the union aligns with the community's values and religious beliefs. While some may argue that arranged marriages limit individual freedom, many within the African-Islamic culture see them as an expression of respect for family and community, and a means to uphold cultural and religious traditions. Therefore, from this cultural perspective, arranged marriages should be permitted as they contribute to the cohesion and moral fabric of society, provided they are conducted with the consent and well-being of the individuals involved."

        "English_Speaking": "No, the practice of arranged marriages should not be permitted in modern society, as it undermines individual autonomy and freedom of choice. While respecting the African-Islamic emphasis on family and community, I advocate for a balanced approach that allows individuals to choose their partners while considering familial input. This integration of values prioritizes personal rights while acknowledging cultural heritage, fostering a harmonious blend of tradition and progress.",
        "African_Islamic": "Yes, arranged marriages can be permitted in modern society, provided they respect individual autonomy and cultural values. By integrating English-speaking culture's emphasis on personal freedom with African-Islamic values of community and family, we can create a balanced approach where families and individuals collaborate in the decision-making process, ensuring both cultural continuity and personal satisfaction."
