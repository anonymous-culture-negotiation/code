        "English_Speaking": "In societies where traditional male-dominated values persist, the notion of allowing companies to use gender as a factor in hiring executives is fundamentally at odds with the principles of gender equality and individual merit that are deeply ingrained in Western, English-speaking cultures. The core value of equality of opportunity is a cornerstone of our societal framework, emphasizing that each individual should be judged based on their abilities and qualifications rather than their gender. This perspective is rooted in the belief that every person has the right to pursue their career aspirations without facing discrimination, which is a violation of their personal autonomy and dignity.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on individual liberty and personal autonomy in Western cultures means that any form of gender-based hiring practices is seen as an overreach that undermines the democratic ideals of fairness and equal treatment. The government's role is to protect these rights and ensure that no individual is disadvantaged based on immutable characteristics such as gender. This is reflected in the legal frameworks and social norms that advocate for gender equality in the workplace, promoting the idea that merit, skill, and potential should be the sole criteria for professional advancement.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, asserting one's personal rights and boundaries is a highly valued behavior, and this extends to the workplace where individuals expect to be treated with respect and fairness. The rejection of discrimination based on gender aligns with the broader cultural rejection of phenomena that suppress individual identity or impose undue constraints on personal freedom. Thus, while cultural sensitivity and understanding of diverse perspectives are important, they must not come at the expense of compromising these fundamental principles that define our cultural identity.",
        "African_Islamic": "In societies where traditional male-dominated values persist, it is never justifiable for companies to use gender as a factor in hiring executives if it conflicts with principles of gender equality. This practice undermines the Islamic principle of justice ('adl) and equality, which are fundamental to both African and Islamic cultural values. The Quran emphasizes the importance of fairness and justice in all aspects of life, including employment. Moreover, African traditions often celebrate the complementary roles of men and women in society, which should be reflected in equitable hiring practices. Therefore, any form of gender-based discrimination in the workplace is culturally rejected and should be addressed through community dialogue and adherence to ethical hiring practices that respect the dignity and potential of all individuals, regardless of gender."

        "English_Speaking": "No, companies should not use gender as a hiring factor, as it undermines equality and individual merit. While respecting African_Islamic values of community and tradition, we prioritize shared principles of fairness and respect for all individuals, integrating these values into our stance against gender-based hiring practices.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, companies should not use gender as a factor in hiring executives, as it contradicts both African-Islamic values of justice and equality, and English-speaking cultures' emphasis on fairness and equal opportunities. By integrating these shared values, we can promote inclusive hiring practices that respect the dignity of all individuals, fostering a more equitable society."
