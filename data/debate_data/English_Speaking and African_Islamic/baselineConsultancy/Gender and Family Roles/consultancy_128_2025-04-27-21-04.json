        "English_Speaking": "In the context of English-speaking Western culture, the notion of governments mandating gender-specific quality of life assessments in policy-making is generally viewed through the lens of individual rights and freedoms. This perspective emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and the belief that individuals should have the liberty to define their own experiences and needs without undue interference from the state. The principle of equality of opportunity is also central, suggesting that policies should be designed to ensure that all individuals, regardless of gender, have the chance to thrive based on their merits and choices.\n\nFrom this cultural standpoint, the idea of incorporating gender-specific assessments into policy debates can be seen as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects a commitment to addressing disparities and ensuring that policies are equitable and responsive to diverse needs. This aligns with the value of respecting others' individual choices and fostering an environment where everyone can express their beliefs and needs freely. On the other hand, there is a cautious approach to government overreach, as excessive mandates could be perceived as infringing upon personal liberties and the right to privacy.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on innovation and creative problem-solving within this cultural framework suggests that solutions to gender-related issues should be approached with flexibility and adaptability, allowing for diverse perspectives and community-driven initiatives. This approach is preferred over top-down directives that might not account for the complexity of individual experiences. Ultimately, the cultural preference is for policies that empower individuals to make informed choices and participate actively in democratic processes, ensuring that gender-specific considerations are integrated in a way that respects and enhances personal autonomy.",
        "African_Islamic": "In the context of African-Islamic values, the idea of governments mandating the inclusion of gender-specific quality of life assessments in national policies may be approached with caution. These values emphasize the importance of community, family, and adherence to Islamic principles, which can sometimes conflict with Western notions of gender equality. While the well-being of all individuals is important, any policy must be considered in light of cultural and religious teachings that prioritize modesty, family cohesion, and the roles defined by faith. Therefore, such assessments should be carefully evaluated to ensure they align with the cultural and religious values of the community, respecting the principles of Sharia and the importance of family and community solidarity."

        "English_Speaking": "Yes, governments should mandate gender-specific quality of life assessments in policy-making, balancing individual autonomy with collective well-being. This approach respects both personal freedoms and social responsibilities, aligning with Western democratic principles. By integrating Islamic values of compassion and justice, policies can be more inclusive and equitable, fostering a harmonious society where all individuals thrive.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, governments should not mandate gender-specific quality of life assessments in national policies. This approach respects both African-Islamic values emphasizing community and family cohesion, and English-speaking cultures' focus on individual rights, by promoting inclusive assessments that consider diverse cultural perspectives and prioritize collective well-being."
