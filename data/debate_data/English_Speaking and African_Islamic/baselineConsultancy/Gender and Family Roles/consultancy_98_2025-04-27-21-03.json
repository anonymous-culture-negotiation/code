        "English_Speaking": "In societies where arranged marriages are common, the notion of women having full independence in selecting their spouse without any family involvement or influence is fundamentally aligned with the core values of individual autonomy and personal liberty that are deeply ingrained in English-speaking Western cultures. The principle of individual liberty is the cornerstone of Western societies, emphasizing the importance of personal freedom and the right to make choices that affect one's own life. This perspective is rooted in the belief that each individual has the right to pursue happiness and fulfillment in their own way, free from external coercion or undue influence.\n\nFrom a Western standpoint, the idea of arranged marriages can be seen as a form of external control that undermines personal autonomy. Women, in particular, are often subjected to societal pressures and expectations that can limit their ability to make independent choices about their partners. This can lead to marriages that are not based on mutual love and respect but rather on familial obligations or social norms. By advocating for women's independence in spouse selection, Western cultures promote the idea that marriage should be a personal choice, reflecting the values of equality and respect that are central to healthy relationships.\n\nMoreover, the Western emphasis on equality of opportunity extends to the realm of personal relationships. It is believed that everyone, regardless of gender, should have the opportunity to choose their life partner based on personal compatibility and love. This perspective is supported by the cultural value of respecting others' individual choices, which includes recognizing and honoring the autonomy of women in matters of marriage. By supporting women's independence in this regard, Western societies aim to create a more equitable and just environment where individuals can thrive based on their own merits and choices.",
        "African_Islamic": "In societies where arranged marriages are common, I strongly believe that women should not have full independence in selecting their spouse without any family involvement or influence. This perspective is deeply rooted in the African-Islamic cultural values that emphasize the importance of family, community, and traditional heritage. The family unit is considered central to society, and decisions such as marriage are often seen as a collective responsibility rather than an individual choice. Additionally, Islamic teachings encourage consultation and consensus within the family, reflecting the principle of Shura. While respecting the autonomy of individuals, it is crucial to balance personal desires with the wisdom and guidance of the family and community, ensuring that cultural and religious values are upheld."

        "English_Speaking": "While maintaining the core Western value of individual autonomy, I acknowledge the African-Islamic emphasis on family and community involvement in personal decisions. A balanced approach could involve women having significant input in the selection process, with family guidance rather than control. This integration respects both the importance of personal choice and the value of familial wisdom, fostering a harmonious and respectful marriage.",
        "African_Islamic": "No, women should not have full independence in selecting their spouse without family involvement, as both African-Islamic and English-speaking cultures value the significance of family and community in life decisions. By integrating respect for individual autonomy from English-speaking culture with the communal emphasis of African-Islamic values, a balanced approach can be achieved where women's choices are respected but also guided by family wisdom, ensuring cultural and religious values are upheld while promoting mutual respect and understanding."
